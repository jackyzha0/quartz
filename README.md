# Quartz v4

> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.

Please note that v4 is still beta software and will probably contain bugs. Use with caution!

**If you are looking for Quartz v3, you can find it on the [`hugo` branch](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/tree/hugo).**
