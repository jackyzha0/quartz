Quartz's plugins are a series of transformations over content. This is illustrated in the diagram of the processing pipeline below:

![[quartz transform pipeline.png]]

All plugins are defined as a function that takes in a single parameter for options `type OptionType = object | undefined` and return an object that corresponds to the type of plugin it is.

```ts
type OptionType = object | undefined
type QuartzPlugin<Options extends OptionType = undefined> = (opts?: Options) => QuartzPluginInstance
type QuartzPluginInstance =
  | QuartzTransformerPluginInstance
  | QuartzFilterPluginInstance
  | QuartzEmitterPluginInstance
```

The following sections will go into detail for what methods can be implemented for each plugin type. Before we do that, let's clarify a few more ambiguous types:

- `BuildCtx` is defined in `quartz/ctx.ts`. It consists of
  - `argv`: The command line arguments passed to the Quartz [[build]] command
  - `cfg`: The full Quartz [[configuration]]
  - `allSlugs`: a list of all the valid content slugs (see [[paths]] for more information on what a `ServerSlug` is)
- `StaticResources` is defined in `quartz/resources.tsx`. It consists of
  - `css`: a list of URLs for stylesheets that should be loaded
  - `js`: a list of scripts that should be loaded. A script is described with the `JSResource` type which is also defined in `quartz/resources.tsx`. It allows you to define a load time (either before or after the DOM has been loaded), whether it should be a module, and either the source URL or the inline content of the script.

## Transformers

Transformers **map** over content, taking a Markdown file and outputting modified content or adding metadata to the file itself.

```ts
export type QuartzTransformerPluginInstance = {
  name: string
  textTransform?: (ctx: BuildCtx, src: string | Buffer) => string | Buffer
  markdownPlugins?: (ctx: BuildCtx) => PluggableList
  htmlPlugins?: (ctx: BuildCtx) => PluggableList
  externalResources?: (ctx: BuildCtx) => Partial<StaticResources>
}
```

All transformer plugins must define at least a `name` field to register the plugin and a few optional functions that allow you to hook into various parts of transforming a single Markdown file.

- `textTransform` performs a text-to-text transformation _before_ a file is parsed into the [Markdown AST](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast).
- `markdownPlugins` defines a list of [remark plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md). `remark` is a tool that transforms Markdown to Markdown in a structured way.
- `htmlPlugins` defines a list of [rehype plugins](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/main/doc/plugins.md). Similar to how `remark` works, `rehype` is a tool that transforms HTML to HTML in a structured way.
- `externalResources` defines any external resources the plugin may need to load on the client-side for it to work properly.

Normally for both `remark` and `rehype`, you can find existing plugins that you can use to . If you'd like to create your own `remark` or `rehype` plugin, checkout the [guide to creating a plugin](https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/create-a-plugin/) using `unified` (the underlying AST parser and transformer library).

A good example of a transformer plugin that borrows from the `remark` and `rehype` ecosystems is the [[Latex]] plugin:

```ts title="quartz/plugins/transformers/latex.ts"
import remarkMath from "remark-math"
import rehypeKatex from "rehype-katex"
import rehypeMathjax from "rehype-mathjax/svg.js"
import { QuartzTransformerPlugin } from "../types"

interface Options {
  renderEngine: "katex" | "mathjax"
}

export const Latex: QuartzTransformerPlugin<Options> = (opts?: Options) => {
  const engine = opts?.renderEngine ?? "katex"
  return {
    name: "Latex",
    markdownPlugins() {
      return [remarkMath]
    },
    htmlPlugins() {
      if (engine === "katex") {
        // if you need to pass options into a plugin, you
        // can use a tuple of [plugin, options]
        return [[rehypeKatex, { output: "html" }]]
      } else {
        return [rehypeMathjax]
      }
    },
    externalResources() {
      if (engine === "katex") {
        return {
          css: ["https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.0/dist/katex.min.css"],
          js: [
            {
              src: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.7/dist/contrib/copy-tex.min.js",
              loadTime: "afterDOMReady",
              contentType: "external",
            },
          ],
        }
      } else {
        return {}
      }
    },
  }
}
```

Another common thing that transformer plugins will do is parse a file and add extra data for that file:

```ts
export const AddWordCount: QuartzTransformerPlugin = () => {
  return {
    name: "AddWordCount",
    markdownPlugins() {
      return [
        () => {
          return (tree, file) => {
            // tree is an `mdast` root element
            // file is a `vfile`
            const text = file.value
            const words = text.split(" ").length
            file.data.wordcount = words
          }
        },
      ]
    },
  }
}

// tell typescript about our custom data fields we are adding
// other plugins will then also be aware of this data field
declare module "vfile" {
  interface DataMap {
    wordcount: number
  }
}
```

Finally, you can also perform transformations over Markdown or HTML ASTs using the `visit` function from the `unist-util-visit` package or the `findAndReplace` function from the `mdast-util-find-and-replace` package.

```ts
export const TextTransforms: QuartzTransformerPlugin = () => {
  return {
    name: "TextTransforms",
    markdownPlugins() {
      return [() => {
        return (tree, file) => {
          // replace _text_ with the italics version
          findAndReplace(tree, /_(.+)_/, (_value: string, ...capture: string[]) => {
            // inner is the text inside of the () of the regex
            const [inner] = capture
            // return an mdast node
            // https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast
            return {
              type: "emphasis",
              children: [{ type: 'text', value: inner }]
            }
          })

         // remove all links (replace with just the link content)
         // match by 'type' field on an mdast node
         // https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#link in this example
          visit(tree, "link", (link: Link) => {
            return {
              type: "paragraph"
              children: [{ type: 'text', value: link.title }]
            }
          })
        }
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

All transformer plugins can be found under `quartz/plugins/transformers`. If you decide to write your own transformer plugin, don't forget to re-export it under `quartz/plugins/transformers/index.ts`

A parting word: transformer plugins are quite complex so don't worry if you don't get them right away. Take a look at the built in transformers and see how they operate over content to get a better sense for how to accomplish what you are trying to do.

## Filters

Filters **filter** content, taking the output of all the transformers and determining what files to actually keep and what to discard.

```ts
export type QuartzFilterPlugin<Options extends OptionType = undefined> = (
  opts?: Options,
) => QuartzFilterPluginInstance

export type QuartzFilterPluginInstance = {
  name: string
  shouldPublish(ctx: BuildCtx, content: ProcessedContent): boolean
}
```

A filter plugin must define a `name` field and a `shouldPublish` function that takes in a piece of content that has been processed by all the transformers and returns a `true` or `false` depending on whether it should be passed to the emitter plugins or not.

For example, here is the built-in plugin for removing drafts:

```ts title="quartz/plugins/filters/draft.ts"
import { QuartzFilterPlugin } from "../types"

export const RemoveDrafts: QuartzFilterPlugin<{}> = () => ({
  name: "RemoveDrafts",
  shouldPublish(_ctx, [_tree, vfile]) {
    // uses frontmatter parsed from transformers
    const draftFlag: boolean = vfile.data?.frontmatter?.draft ?? false
    return !draftFlag
  },
})
```

## Emitters

Emitters **reduce** over content, taking in a list of all the transformed and filtered content and creating output files.

```ts
export type QuartzEmitterPlugin<Options extends OptionType = undefined> = (
  opts?: Options,
) => QuartzEmitterPluginInstance

export type QuartzEmitterPluginInstance = {
  name: string
  emit(
    ctx: BuildCtx,
    content: ProcessedContent[],
    resources: StaticResources,
    emitCallback: EmitCallback,
  ): Promise<FilePath[]>
  getQuartzComponents(ctx: BuildCtx): QuartzComponent[]
}
```

An emitter plugin must define a `name` field an `emit` function and a `getQuartzComponents` function. `emit` is responsible for looking at all the parsed and filtered content and then appropriately creating files and returning a list of paths to files the plugin created.

Creating new files can be done via regular Node [fs module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) (i.e. `fs.cp` or `fs.writeFile`) or via the `emitCallback` if you are creating files that contain text. The `emitCallback` function is the 4th argument of the emit function. It's interface looks something like this:

```ts
export type EmitCallback = (data: {
  // the name of the file to emit (not including the file extension)
  slug: ServerSlug
  // the file extension
  ext: `.${string}` | ""
  // the file content to add
  content: string
}) => Promise<FilePath>
```

This is a thin wrapper around writing to the appropriate output folder and ensuring that intermediate directories exist. If you choose to use the native Node `fs` APIs, ensure you emit to the `argv.output` folder as well.

If you are creating an emitter plugin that needs to render components, there are three more things to be aware of:

- Your component should use `getQuartzComponents` to declare a list of `QuartzComponents` that it uses to construct the page. See the page on [[creating components]] for more information.
- You can use the `renderPage` function defined in `quartz/components/renderPage.tsx` to render Quartz components into HTML.
- If you need to render an HTML AST to JSX, you can use the `toJsxRuntime` function from `hast-util-to-jsx-runtime` library. An example of this can be found in `quartz/components/pages/Content.tsx`.

For example, the following is a simplified version of the content page plugin that renders every single page.

```tsx title="quartz/plugins/emitters/contentPage.tsx"
export const ContentPage: QuartzEmitterPlugin = () => {
  // construct the layout
  const layout: FullPageLayout = {
    ...sharedPageComponents,
    ...defaultContentPageLayout,
    pageBody: Content(),
  }
  const { head, header, beforeBody, pageBody, left, right, footer } = layout
  return {
    name: "ContentPage",
    getQuartzComponents() {
      return [head, ...header, ...beforeBody, pageBody, ...left, ...right, footer]
    },
    async emit(ctx, content, resources, emit): Promise<FilePath[]> {
      const cfg = ctx.cfg.configuration
      const fps: FilePath[] = []
      const allFiles = content.map((c) => c[1].data)
      for (const [tree, file] of content) {
        const slug = canonicalizeServer(file.data.slug!)
        const externalResources = pageResources(slug, resources)
        const componentData: QuartzComponentProps = {
          fileData: file.data,
          externalResources,
          cfg,
          children: [],
          tree,
          allFiles,
        }

        const content = renderPage(slug, componentData, opts, externalResources)
        const fp = await emit({
          content,
          slug: file.data.slug!,
          ext: ".html",
        })

        fps.push(fp)
      }
      return fps
    },
  }
}
```

Note that it takes in a `FullPageLayout` as the options. It's made by combining a `SharedLayout` and a `PageLayout` both of which are provided through the `quartz.layout.ts` file.
