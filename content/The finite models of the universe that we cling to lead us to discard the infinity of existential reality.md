## The finite models of the universe that we cling to lead us to discard the infinity of existential reality  #🧠 

Existential reality seems endless; the deeper you look into it, the more you see. It has this sense of infinity about it. The "real" universe—the [[reality tunnel]] that has become experienced as the real universe through [[Idolatry]]—is, on the other hand, quite finite. It is compact and tidy, since it has been manufactured by our [[left hemisphere]] discarding all inconvenient parts of our existential experience: [[Our left hemisphere unconsciously focuses on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]]. This is why those self-hypnotized by a "real" universe of this sort can be so oblivious to the existential continuum around them.
