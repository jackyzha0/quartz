## Babies and children are more reliant on the right hemisphere than the left #🧠 

[[The cerebral hemispheres are more independent in babies and children]], and they are also more reliant on the [[right hemisphere]], which matures earlier than the left, and it may be that it is the increasing importance of [[left hemisphere]] function with age that necessitates the separation, in both hemispheres' interests, of their realms of activity. The Berlin Wall that meets this need would be the increasingly efficient [[corpus callosum]].
