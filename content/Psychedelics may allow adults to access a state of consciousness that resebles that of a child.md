## Psychedelics may allow adults to access a state of consciousness that resebles that of a child  # 

By now, it may be lost to memory, but all of us, even the [[psychedelic]]ally naive, have had direct personal experience of a [[high-entropy state]] and the novel type of [[consciousness]] it sponsors—as a young child. Baby [[consciousness]] is so different from adult [[consciousness]] as to constitute a mental country of its own, one from which we are expelled sometime early in adolescence. Is there a way back in? The closest we can come to visiting that foreign land as adults may be during the [[psychedelic]] journey. In much the same way [[psychedelic]]s have given Dr. [[Robert Carhart-Harris]] an oblique angle from which to approach the phenomena of normal consciousness by exploring an altered state of it, Dr. [[Alison Gopnik]] proposes we regard the mind of the young child as another kind of “altered state,” and in a number of respects it is a strikingly similar one.

She cautions that our thinking about the subject is usually constrained by our own restricted experience of [[consciousness]], which we naturally take to be the whole of it. In this case, most of the theories and generalizations about [[consciousness]] have been made by people who share a fairly limited subtype of it she calls “professor consciousness,” which she defines as “the phenomenology of your average middle-aged professor.” “As academics, either we’re incredibly focused on a particular problem,” Gopnik told the audience of philosophers and neuroscientists in Tucson, “or we’re sitting there saying to ourselves, ‘Why can’t I focus on this problem I’m supposed to be focused on, and why instead am I daydreaming?’” “If you thought, as people often have thought, that this was all there was to [[consciousness]] . . . you might very well find yourself thinking that young children were actually less conscious than we were,” because both focused attention and self-reflection are absent in young children. Gopnik asks us to think about child [[consciousness]] in terms of not what’s missing from it or undeveloped but rather what is uniquely and wonderfully present—qualities that she believes [[psychedelic]]s can help us to better appreciate and, possibly, reexperience. In The Philosophical Baby, Gopnik draws a useful distinction between the “[[spotlight consciousness]]” of adults and the “[[lantern consciousness]]” of young children.
