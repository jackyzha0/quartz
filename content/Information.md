## Information  #⏳ 

In mathematical information theory, information denotes the amount of unpredictability in a message; information is, roughly, what you do not expect to hear. If you know something already, or can predict it easily on the basis of what you do know, it is not information for you. Conversely, if you don’t know something, or can’t predict it, it is information. In this sense, information may be "true" or "false," but it is always a pleasant surprise. The amount of resistance when confronted with new information measures the degree of [[Fundamentalism]] in a culture, a sub-culture, or an individual.
