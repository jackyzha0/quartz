## The reality that we observe is being co-created by our minds  # 

Einstein's physical relativity is a special case of a general neurological relativity: the observer always remains co-creator of the observation. To quote Nietzsche again: "We are all greater artists than we realize." Each nervous system creates a magnificant artwork which it usually calls "the" "real" "reality" in the philosphical sense and projects outward. These [[reality tunnel]]s, assumed to be "realities" and experienced as "realities," are not only as varied as the paintings of Van Gogh and Picasso, they are marvously creative as Beethoven and Mozart; they are as miscellaneous as the novelistic styles of [[James Joyce]] and [[Lewis Carroll]].
