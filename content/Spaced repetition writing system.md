A [[Spaced repetition writing system]] combines two evidence-based approaches to learning: (1) [[Write permanent notes about what you read to test understanding]] and (2) [[Spaced repetition]].

A spaced repetition writing system is motivating because it is designed to help you work more on ideas that are really interesting to you incrementally—just a few prompts a day, which you return to in different intervals. By following this process, you avoid ignoring the piling inklings you collected in your [[writing inbox]] and effectively drain them to write [[Evergreens]]. The system allows you to [[Combine curiosity with a note-writing system and practice]] and [[Use curiosity to guide your thinking]] thus [[Establish a workflow that is motivating]].

For the ideas behind this system, see [[How to implement a spaced repetition writing system]].
