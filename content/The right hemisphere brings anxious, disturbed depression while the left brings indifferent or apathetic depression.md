## The right hemisphere brings anxious, disturbed depression while the left brings indifferent or apathetic depression  # 

There is also evidence that the types of [[depression]] experienced in right posterior hypoactivity are different from those experienced in left frontal hypoactivity, in ways which are in keeping with the views of the worlds that the two [[brain hemisphere]]s bring into being. Thus [[depression]] resulting from damage to the [[right hemisphere]] has more of indifference or apathy – a global, vague lifelessness – in contrast to the anxious, disturbed depression, accompanied by biological features, resulting from lesions to the [[left hemisphere]]. The sort of anxiety that accompanies depressed mood, and could be induced by reading a sad narrative, is known as anxious arousal, and shows greater lateralisation to the [[right hemisphere]]. By contrast anxious apprehension, based as it is on a fear of uncertainty and lack of control—preoccupations of the [[left hemisphere]]—is accompanied by preferential [[left hemisphere]] activation.
