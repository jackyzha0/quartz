## A languages structure and grammatic rules can distort how we interpret and percieve reality  #🧠 

In considering that [[language can be seen as a kind of metaphor]], more subtle issues arise when we consider the structure of a system of metaphors interlinked with the grammatical rules of a language. [[René Descartes|Descartes]], who tried to doubt everything, or at least says he tried, found that he could not doubt the proposition "i think therefor i am."  He could not doubt that proposition because he only knew Indo-European languages, and It is an Indo-European linguistic convention that a verb must be preceded by a substanative noun—that an action must be attributed to some allegedly isolated and [[reification|reified]] actor. It is this convention that is the reason why we still say "_it_ is raining" even though we no longer believe in Zeus or any other rain god and would be hard put to say what else "_it_" might refer to.

These linguistic structural factors may explain some of the great internal conflicts within philosophy. If [[René Descartes|Descartes]] were to think in a French that was even more latinate than todays, he would percieve "un pomme grosse et rouge" and conclude that the mind starts with general ideas and then determines paticulars. Whereas [[John Locke]], thinking in english, would percieve an object such as "a big red apple" and deduct that the mind starts from particulars and then assembles general ideas.
