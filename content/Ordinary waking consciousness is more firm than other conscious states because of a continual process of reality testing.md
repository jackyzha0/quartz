## Ordinary waking consciousness is more firm because it involves of a continual process of reality testing # 

If [[the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input]], how is normal waking [[consciousness]] any different from other, seemingly less faithful productions of our imagination—such as dreams or psychotic delusions or [[psychedelic]] trips? In fact, all these states of [[consciousness]] are “imagined”: they’re mental constructs that weave together some news of the world with priors of various kinds. But in the case of normal waking [[consciousness]], the handshake between the data of our senses and our preconceptions is especially firm. That’s because [[novelty is handled by the right hemisphere, and is transferred to the left hemisphere as it becomes familiar]], and [[the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]]. This subjects us to a continual process of reality testing, as when you reach out to confirm the existence of the object in your visual field or, upon waking from a nightmare, consult your memory to see if you really did show up to teach a class without any clothes on. Unlike these other states of consciousness, ordinary waking [[consciousness]] has been optimized by natural selection to best facilitate our everyday survival.

Indeed, that feeling of transparency we associate with ordinary [[consciousness]] may owe more to familiarity and [[habit]] than it does to verisimilitude. [[Because perception is not absolute, all of our ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferential]]. If it were possible to temporarily experience another person’s mental state, it would probably feel more like a [[psychedelic]] state than a ‘normal’ state, because of its massive disparity with whatever mental state is [[habit]]ual with you. Another trippy thought experiment is to try to imagine the world as it appears to a creature with an entirely different sensory apparatus and way of life. You quickly realize there is no single reality out there waiting to be faithfully and comprehensively transcribed.
