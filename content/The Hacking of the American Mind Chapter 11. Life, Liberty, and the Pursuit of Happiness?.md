We’re told that things will make us happy, but they don’t. We’re told we should be ecstatic, but we’re not. Because what we’re told is based on a faulty premise—that pleasure and happiness are one and the same. A premise ingrained in the American psyche, and indeed throughout Western civilization.

last clause of the Declaration, “the pursuit of happiness,” has a very checkered history. It was mentioned twice in print in 1776, and then it disappeared, never to be written again. In its place, the U.S. Constitution replaced the word “happiness” with “property.” The acquisition of the tangible quickly superseded the quest for inner contentment.

Aristotle argued “the pursuit of happiness and the avoidance of pain is a first principle; for it is for the sake of this that we do all that we do.”
