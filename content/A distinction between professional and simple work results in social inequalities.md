## A distinction between professional and simple work results in social inequalities  # 

Some collectivist writers maintain that a distinction should be made between qualified or professional work and simple work. But to establish this distinction would be to maintain all the inequalities of present society. It would mean fixing a dividing line, from the beginning, between the workers and those who pretend to govern them. It would mean dividing society into two very distinct classes and the one doomed to serve the other; the one working with its hands to feed and clothe those who, profiting by their leisure, study how to govern their fosterers. It would mean reviving one of the distinct peculiarities of present society and giving it the sanction of the social revolution. It would mean setting up as a principle an abuse already condemned in our society today. This is one reason why [[upon abolishing private property, wages would also have to be abolished along with it]].
