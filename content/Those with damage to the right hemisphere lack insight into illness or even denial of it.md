## Those with damage to the right hemisphere lack insight into illness or even denial of it # 

[[The right hemisphere is more self-aware and realistic, while the left is more grandiose, optimistic, and unrealistic about it's shortcomings]]. Also, Insight into illness generally is dependent on the [[right hemisphere]], and those who have damage to the [[right hemisphere]] tend to deny their illness—the well—recognized, and extraordinary phenomenon of [[anosognosia]], in which patients deny or radically minimize the fact that they have, for example, a blatant loss of use of what may be one entire half of the body. A patient with a completely paralyzed (left) limb may pointedly refuse to accept that there is anything wrong with it, and will come up with the most preposterous explanations for why he is not actually able to move it on request ([[The left hemisphere will confabulate explanations for things it doesn't know and seems completely convinced of them]]). This happens to some degree in the majority of cases after a stroke affecting the left side of the body (involving [[right hemisphere]] damage), but practically never after a right-sided stroke (involving [[left hemisphere]] damage). The phenomenon of denial can be temporarily reversed by activating the affected [[right hemisphere]]. Equally, denial of illness ([[anosognosia]]) can be induced by anesthetizing the [[right hemisphere]].

Note that it is not just a blindness, a failure to see – it's a willful denial. Hoff and Pötzl describe a patient who demonstrates this beautifully: ‘On examination, when she is shown her left hand in the right visual field, she looks away and says ‘I don't see it.’ She spontaneously hides her left hand under the bedclothes or puts it behind her back. She never looks to the left, even when called from that side.’ If forced to confront the affected limb, there is not infrequently a sense of revulsion from it, known as misoplegia: if the examiner puts the patient's own left hand in her right hand, ‘she takes hold of it only to drop it immediately with an expression of disgust’.
