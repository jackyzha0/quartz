## Neurosomatic Circuit Exersizes  # 

1. Get the lesson book from the local Christian Science Reading Room and read the lessons for a month.

2. Attend a Sufi week-end seminar.

3. Acquire my book Sex & Drugs: A Journey Beyond Limits and try the Tantric exercizes there described.

4. Learn how to do [[mindfulness of breathing]] properly. 

5. [[Da Free John]], an American guru, says you can reach Illumination by constantly asking, “Who is the One who is living me now?” Well—is it [[Limbic system]] consciousness. [[Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] ego. [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit|Semantic Circuit]] mind, [[Socio-Sexual Circuit]] sex-role. [[Neurosomatic Circuit]] Gestalt-field, or a higher circuit? Who is it? Where is it? How old is it?

6. Dr. [[Aiden Kelly]] has suggested that the so-called “unconscious” is more conscious than the so-called conscious mind. That is, the “unconscious” contains all the feedbacks of the [[Neurosomatic Circuit]] and the other circuits that maintain life. Consider this idea. Is this the “One who is living you now”?
