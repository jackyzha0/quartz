## The left hemisphere will confabulate explanations for things it doesn't know and seems completely convinced of them # 

[[The left hemisphere of split-brain subjects has been shown to have to come up with random reasons for things the right hemisphere does]]. This may be linked to a phenomenon known as confabulation, where the [[brain]], not being able to recall something, rather than admit to a gap in its understanding, makes up something plausible, that appears consistent, to fill it. Thus, for example, in the presence of a [[right hemisphere]] lesion, the [[brain]] loses the contextual information that would help it make sense of experience ([[The right hemisphere sees things in their context]]); the [[left hemisphere]], nothing loath, makes up a story, and, lacking insight, appears completely convinced by it. Even in the absence of [[amnesia]], the [[left hemisphere]] exhibits a strong tendency to confabulate: it thinks it knows something, recognizes something, which it doesn't, a tendency that may be linked to its lack of ability to discriminate unique cases from the generalized categories into which it places them: [[The right hemisphere allows for the recognition of uniqueness and familiarity, while the left only re-presents generic categories of things]].

The [[left hemisphere]] is the equivalent of the sort of person who, when asked for directions, prefers to make something up rather than admit to not knowing. This impression is confirmed by Panksepp: ‘The linguistically proficient [[left hemisphere]] … appears predisposed to repress negative emotions, and even chooses to confabulate.’ To some extent perhaps we inevitably confabulate stories about our lives, a process overseen by what [[Micheal Gazzaniga]] calls the [[left hemisphere]] ‘interpreter’. However, it is the [[right hemisphere]] that makes judgments about the truth or plausibility of these narratives.
