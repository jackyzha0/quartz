## Introduction

This is the source code for [Forgetful Notes](https://forgetfulnotes.com)—my digital garden of knowledge. It serves as a platform for my learning and creative endeavours. A space for thinking through, building upon, and coming back to.

It is powered by [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). You can read the [Documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), and join the [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t).
