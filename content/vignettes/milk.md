“I am feeling down the entire week,” I said.

“Me too,” she answered.

Then the text messages ended there.

I placed my phone down on the table, then held the glass of milk, which I  have just prepared. Seeing that the powder was beginning to coalesce at the bottom of the glass, I started stirring. My father used to tell me that drinking milk before going to sleep was a good idea. He watched me drink one glass before kissing him goodnight when I was in grade school. I am not sure if it really worked, but I can’t think of anything else to do. Yesterday, I only had about four hours of sleep, and even those four hours were disjointed. I woke up several times in the evening until I gave up and just lied down staring at the ceiling.

Weird, but that sleepless night coincided with an odd pinching sensation on the left front of my head. It wasn’t painful. It was just annoying. It cannot be ignored. It was there, appearing out of nowhere, telling me something I cannot fully understand.

I drank the milk in one go, walked towards the sink, and started washing the glass. After this, I headed back to my room, where my netbook is open. I sat down on the bed as I opened the media player. I picked up the song book, opened it, and started playing a new Kingdom song published by the society last year.

*Young man and young woman,*  
*do give your heart to me.*  
*My foe who now taunts me*  
*will then be made to see.*  

If the milk isn’t enough, perhaps singing God’s song will suffice.

*Your youth and devotion*  
*to me you freely give;*  
*You show all the world*  
*that for me you really live.*  

I felt the pinching sensation again.

I drank the milk and I’m singing the song. But I know in my heart, I will never find sleep tonight.
