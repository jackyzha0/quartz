Trees I recognized today
Apitong - because of its leaf. A small one has died or dying.
Malaasim
Ipil - that large tree with lichens and weird acnes that has circular seeds

Trees and plants are the most difficult to establish relationship with. Because they dont move, but most esp those that dont have bright color, silent workers, who provide unrecognized benefits to the ecosystem but we will never know if we dont look closer.

It is so difficult to appreciate trees, the forest, in that situation.  Land with mosquitos all around.
