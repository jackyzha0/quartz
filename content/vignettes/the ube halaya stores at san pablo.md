When you enter San Pablo, before the city proper, there is a very long stretch of ube halaya vendors. Almost everyone is the same. They painted their stores in violet. The only way to standout is to make a really good product, and perhaps change your branding. There are  some stores that are not colored violet.

The stores are selling a secondary product: tikew. The number of stores beats the kind of competition present in Los Baños among pasalubong stores. There are possibly 40 to 50 stores selling the same product to the point tha they have to create a "mag-uube" association perhaps to control pricing etc.

There are also lots of old dilapidated buildings. Not old vintage buildings but modern-looking buildings that were just abandoned.
