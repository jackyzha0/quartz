![[D41EFC27-FA9B-4C1D-B39A-1F351719D552.jpeg|400]]

The serotonergic pathway is a part of the [[limbic system]] and involves an area in the [[midbrain]] called the [[dorsal raphe nucleus]] which contains [[neuron]]s that produce the [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]], which then fans out to distant sites all over the [[cerebral cortex]]. [[Serotonin]] acts in different ways on different [[neuron]]s, depending on each [[neuron]]’s function and the type of [[receptor]] that sits on its surface.
