The Wilderness is what I use to describe the state of being "unexplored" of a few things

1. I use it to refer to the unexplored life, which newborn human beings are thrown into.
2. I use it to refer to unexplored physical space in general, specifically those I haven't walked on yet, places I don't have an intimate relationship with. This is what I call [[Wilderness of geographic space]].
3. I use it to refer to unexplored ideas, concepts, thoughts, experiences, images, and other contents of the mind. This is what I call [[Wilderness of the mind]]

I am inspired by how [[thoughts/henry bugbee]] uses it.

To do
- Write a note about Henry Bugbee's conceptualization of wilderness.
- Write a note about Thoreau's idea of wilderness.
