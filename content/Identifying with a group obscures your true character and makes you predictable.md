## Identifying with a group obscures your true character and makes you predictable  # 

The primary objection [[In-group and out-group|in-group]] behavior is that it obscures who you really are as a individual. But by doing your own work, you reinforce who you truly are and become capable of being truly known. Furthermore, a person who has embraced a particular creed is completely predictable because [[We generally struggle to examine and criticize our own neural programs]]. By knowing ones sect, you can anticipate their argument. You should expect them not to say anything spontaneous and original. 

Unfortunately, most people have attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion. This [[conformity]] makes them not false in a few ways, but false in all ways. Their every truth is not quite true, but is someone elses. Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four.
