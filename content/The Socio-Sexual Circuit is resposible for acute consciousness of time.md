## The Socio-Sexual Circuit is resposible for acute consciousness of time # 

Time-binding (the transmission of symbols and tools across generations) begins on the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]]. Acute consciousness time is, however, intensified on the [[Socio-Sexual Circuit]]. The principle function of the socio-sexual circuit, in the higher primates, is to form an adult personality—a parent. By definition, the parent is one who cares for the young of the species; by genetic necessity, the parent also cares about the young. In symbolizing humans, this means planning, hoping and having aspirations. In the language of the mystics, this means being “attached” and “trapped on the wheel of [[Samsara]]”; the first effort in most mystical traditions is to break this [[Socio-Sexual Circuit]] attachment by taking a vow of celibacy.
