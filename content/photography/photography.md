A long time ago I did a lot of sports. I played football, tennis and skateboarded. I used to spend my evenings at a skate park and suddenly I had a knee injury. I had always loved photography, so I saved some money and bought a 2.1 megapixel Kodak digital camera. I started taking pictures of my friends skateboarding and messing around. 

Now time has passed and I have given up digital cameras and only use film cameras.
