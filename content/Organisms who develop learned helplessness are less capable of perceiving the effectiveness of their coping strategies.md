## Organisms who develop learned helplessness are less capable of perceiving the effectiveness of their coping strategies # 

Not only do [[People who develop learned helplessness lack the motivation to apply coping strategies in adverse situations]], animals with [[learned helplessness]] also have a cognitive problem—something is awry with how they perceive and think about the world. When they do make the rare coping response, they can’t tell whether it works or not. For example, if you tighten the association between a coping response and a reward, a normal rat’s response rate increases (in other words, if the coping response works for the rat, it persists in that response). In contrast, linking rewards more closely to the rare coping responses of a helpless rat has little effect on its response rate.

Psychologist [[Martin Seligman]] believes that this is not a consequence of helpless animals somehow missing the rules of the task; instead, he thinks, they have actually learned not to bother paying attention. By all logic, that rat should have learned, “When I am getting shocked, there is absolutely nothing I can do, and that feels terrible, but it isn’t the whole world; it isn’t true for everything.” Instead, it has learned, “There is _nothing_ I can do. _Ever_.”  Even when control and mastery are potentially made available to it, the rat cannot perceive them. If [[Our left hemisphere unconsciously focuses on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]], then their [[brain]]s are tuning out the possibility of control before they're even conscious of the situation. This is very similar to the [[Depression|depressed]] human who always sees glasses half empty. As many cognitive therapists have emphasized, much of what constitutes a [[depression]] is centered around responding to one awful thing and overgeneralizing from it—[[Cognitive distortion|cognitively distorting]] how the world works.
