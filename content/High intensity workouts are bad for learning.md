## High intensity workouts are bad for learning # 

You can’t learn difficult material while you’re exercising at high intensity because blood is shunted away from the [[prefrontal cortex]], and this hampers your [[executive function]]. For example, while working out on the treadmill or the stationary bike for twenty minutes at a high intensity of 70 to 80 percent of their maximum heart rate, college students perform poorly on tests of complex learning.  However, blood flow shifts back almost immediately after you finish exercising, and this is the perfect time to focus on a project that demands sharp thinking and complex analysis.
