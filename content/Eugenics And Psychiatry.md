Charles Darwin's cousin named Sir Francis Galton he sees this and he's Lee couldn't become the father of the eugenics movement John the idea as a science who was Sir Francis called he was born in 1822 to a rich family in Birmingham England when he was 8 when in 1844 his father died he therefore inherited a lot of money you've never had to work for a living anyway his cousin's book comes out and he immediately grasped this idea he says if the species evolve and and already we have farmers selectively breeding their lifestyle like to improve their pigs and cats and also their plants etc so if if farmers can do that with their livestock and can do it with their plants why can't societies do it with humans is the idea and so the minute you have this idea you're going to start to think about who needs to breed and who does not need to breed so so what is he saying could not the race of men B similarly improved could not be undesirable as we got rid of and the Desirables multiplied so that's his first principle you hear that principle is there just we're gonna start separating society into the Desirables we're gonna help them breathe we're gonna have this other great the undesirables and we're not gonna have that great that's the core principle we're gonna see play out but it starts right away with Sir Francis Galt and that's a key

in 1869 he (Sir Francis Galt) publishes a scientific work called hereditary genius and what he does is he goes around he looks at a thousand I think it's a thousand people yes prominent English leaders bankers scientists writers etc and he finds that those thousand people come from a select group of people in England short of the upper class and he says look at these any sense look it's just a small group of people that are have such accomplishments in ours Now and many are closely related

now obviously why is this well he's a perfect example he doesn't have to work for a living grace he has a chance to you know explore science etcetera obviously what he's really seeing is how class bound the society is but he doesn't see it that way he says these people have better germ plasm that's why they that they succeed so much than the arrest of people they don't succeed because they're in essence inferior and so what does he conclude he says this means that he's talking about how humans if we really look at it are decidedly unequal democratic ideals that men are a quote equal equal value are simply quote and undeniably wrong and cannot last even the ordinary citizen quote is to base for the everyday work of modern civilization so given this thought he immediately says what do we as a society have to do we have to encourage those with good germ plasm to breed and those with bad germ plasm not to breed
