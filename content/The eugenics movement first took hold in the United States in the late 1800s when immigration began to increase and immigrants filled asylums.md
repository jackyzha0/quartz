## The eugenics movement first took hold in the United States in the late 1800s when immigration began to increase and immigrants filled asylums #

Although [[eugenics]] stirred much intellectual debate in England (where it was conceptualized), with a few writers whipping up plays and novels on the Superman to be bred, there was little support in England, at least not before the 1920s, for eugenic laws that would prohibit the “unfit” from marrying or bearing children. But that was not the case in the United States. It was here that a society would first develop laws for compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill and other “unfit” members of society. The U.S. [[eugenics]] movement was funded by the industrial titans of America—[[Andrew Carnegie]], [[John D. Rockefeller Jr]]., and [[Mary Harriman]], widow of the railroad magnate [[Edward Harriman]]—and was championed, to a remarkable extent, by graduates of Harvard, Yale, and other Ivy League universities. 

The asylums were a particularly glaring example of all that was seemingly going wrong in America. In 1850, the U.S. census counted 15,610 insane in a total population of 21 million, or one out of every 1,345 people. Thirty years later, 91,997 people, in a population of 50 million, were deemed insane, or one out of every 554 people. The incidence of insanity had apparently more than doubled in thirty short years. It was a disease on the loose. And who was to blame for this frightening increase in [[mental illness]]? Although only 14 percent of the general population were immigrants, nearly 40 percent of those in state mental hospitals were foreign born. [[Mental illness]] appeared to be spreading throughout the population, and from the WASP perspective, it was immigrants who were the most common carriers of this defect in [[germ plasm]].

At the turn of the twentieth century, melting-pot America provided fertile soil for [[eugenics]]. The first great wave of immigration, in the mid-1800s, had brought more than 5 million Irish and Germans to this country. Now a second great wave of immigration was underway, with nearly 1 million immigrants arriving yearly in the first decade of the twentieth century. And this time the immigrants were even more “foreign”—Jews, Italians, Slavs. The ruling class—white Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs)—saw that the United States was undergoing a great transformation, one that threatened their dominance. The country was becoming less Protestant, less English, and less white.

Not only that, the ruling class only had to look at the country’s crowded slums to see which groups were breeding at the fastest rate. Once the immigrants got here, economist [[Francis Amasa Walker]] concluded in 1891, they had more children, on average, than the native born. Meanwhile, no group seemed to be less fecund than upper-class WASPs. They might have two or three children, while the Irish and their ilk kept on reproducing until their tiny walk-up apartments were filled with eight and nine children. All this resulted, the well-to-do believed, in their having to unfairly shoulder ever more costly social programs for immigrants and misfits—public schools, almshouses, and innumerable insane asylums.
