In extreme cases, those who take their heaviest [[imprint]] on the [[limbic system]] tend to be viscerotonic, because this [[imprint]] determines lifelong [[endocrine]] and glandular processes. Thus, in the extreme they are “baby-faced” in adult life, never lose their “baby-fat,” are plump and round and gentle, etc. Also, [[a secure attachment in childhood is necessary for the development of the capacity to be alone]], so they are easily “hurt” (threatened/terrified) by disapproval of any sort, because in the baby-circuit of the brain, disapproval suggests extinction by loss of the sustenance.
