## The linear view of causation is only a product of recent times emerging during the late Renaissance  # 

Some rough idea of causality has probably been around since the dawn of human intellgence, but the classic Western concept of linear causation in which an action by one thing is said to cause a change in one other thing only emerged after Aristotelian either/or logic was combined with experimental method during the late Renaissance. The first doubts of this causality began among quantum physicists around the 1920s. Now, since non-local effects violate this model of causality, physicists are becoming accustomed to thinking in terms of two kinds of priciples, the causal (local) and the acasual (non-local). [[Dependent Origination]] can also be contrasted with classic Western causation. [[Dependent Origination]] instead views the change as being caused by many factors, not just one or even a few.
