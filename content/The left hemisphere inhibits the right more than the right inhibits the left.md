## The left hemisphere inhibits the right more than the right inhibits the left  # 

Chicks use either eye for different purposes and different views of the world, but chicks using both eyes, however, do not do the splits: they approximate more to the [[right hemisphere]] view. This would align with the fact that [[the global attention of the right hemisphere precedes the narrow attention of the left hemisphere]]. But it may also have to do with the fact that at this stage their hemispheres are relatively independent. For we know that the [[corpus callosum]] permits the [[left hemisphere]] to have an greater inhibitory effect on the [[right hemisphere]] than the [[right hemisphere]] has on the left. In doing so they actually succeed in reversing the natural asymmetry: they impose the [[left hemisphere]] view of the world. Only when interhemispheric communication is rendered impossible by severing of the [[corpus callosum]] does one see, once again, the natural asymmetry in favor of the [[right hemisphere]]'s view of the world appear.
