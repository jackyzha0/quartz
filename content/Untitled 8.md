- Real bonding can only occur in face-to-face groups of reasonable size
- the State is not a gene-pool or a tribe, and cannot really play the bio-survival unit convincingly

Welfare-ism, socialism, totalitarianism, etc. represent attempts, in varying degrees of rationality and hysteria, to re-create the tribal bond by making the State stand-in for the gene-pool. Conservatives who claim that no form of Welfare is tolerable to them are asking that people live with total bio-survival anxiety and anomie combined with terror. The conservatives, of course, vaguely recognize this and ask for “local charity” to replace State Welfare—i.e., they ask for the gene-pool to be restored by magic, among people (denizens of a typical city) who are not genetically related at all. On the other hand, the State is not a gene-pool or a tribe, and cannot really play the bio-survival unit convincingly. Everybody on Welfare becomes paranoid, because they are continually worrying that they are going to get cut off (“exiled”) for some minor infraction of the increasingly incomprehensible bureaucratic rules. And in real totalitarianism, in which the bogus identification of the State with the tribe is carried to the point of a new mysticism, the paranoia becomes total.

Real bonding can only occur in face-to-face groups of reasonable size. Hence, the perpetual attempt (however implausible in industrial circumstances) to decentralize, to go back to the tribal ethos, to replace the State with syndicates (as in anarchism) or affinity-groups (Reich’s “Consciousness III”). Recall the hippie crash-pad of the sixties, which lives on in many rural communes.

Back in the real world, the tickets called “money” are the biosurvival bond for most people. Anti-Semitism is a complex aberration, of many facets and causes, but in its classic form (the “Jewish Bankers’ Conspiracy”) it simply holds that a hostile gene-pool controls the tickets for bio-security. Such paranoia is inevitable in a money economy; junkies have similar myths about who controls the supply of heroin. Thus, as anti-Semitism has declined in America, the “Bankers’ Conspiracy” lives on in a new form. Now the villains are old New England WASP families, the “Yankee Establishment.” Some Leftists will even show you charts of the genealogies of these WASP bankers, the way anti-Semites used to show Rothschild genealogies.
