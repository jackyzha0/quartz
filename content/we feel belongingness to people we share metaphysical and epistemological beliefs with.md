[[The Buddha avoided metaphysics]]. He said it was unimportant and that it prevented us from being compassionate to each other. Overemphasizing our beliefs in [[thoughts/metaphysics]] and [[thoughts/epistemology]] can definitely make us hateful especially when the two are combined into one ideology. [[We agree about what we want and disagree about metaphysics and epistemology]] But [[Metaphysics and epistemology can help us be kinder]]. It will always be part of our conversation about how to relate with other people.

For example, I want to clarify my metaphysical and epistemological beliefs because I first need to create a place of belonging within myself. I first need to feel at home in my body. I want to feel really safe and autonomous and to protect that safe space as much as I can. And from there, expand my sense of belonging. The challenge is of course compassion—to love people outside that circle of belonging that we are ever so interested in building and preserving.

This is the reason why building my worldview through [[thoughts/understanding]] is so important to me and why my immediate environment is so important to me and why I want to be careful and intentional in my relationships.
