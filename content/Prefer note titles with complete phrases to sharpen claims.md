## Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims #⏳ 

[☀️ Main-Sequence Note](Main-Sequence%20Note) titles are usually imperative or declarative sentences making a strong claim. This puts pressure to adequately support the claim in the body. If i struggle to title a note in such a way, it usually means that my thinking is muddy or the note is about too many things. (contra [[Main sequence notes should be atomic]]). The solution in both cases is to break the note into the bits that i understand best.

I usually begin writing the note without knowing what the title is going to be. The title emerges out of the text written. When a note can be given a clear claim. that usually means it is starting to make sense
