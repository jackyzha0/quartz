## Psychiatry has not yet been able to come up with laboratory tests for psychiatric conditions # 

The two most exciting advances in the entire history of biology are unraveling the workings of the human [[brain]] and breaking the [[gene]]tic code. No one could have predicted that we would have come so far and so fast. But there has also been a great disappointment. Although we have learned a great deal about [[brain]] functioning, we have not yet figured out ways of translating basic science into clinical psychiatry. Molecular biology, [[gene]]tics, and imaging have not yet led to laboratory tests for [[dementia]] or [[depression]] or [[schizophrenia]] or [[bipolar]] or [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] or for any other [[mental disorder]]s. The expectation that there would be a simple [[gene]] or [[neurotransmitter]] or circuitry explanation for any [[mental disorder]] has turned out to be naive and illusory. [[An overabundance of dopamine in schizophrenics has yet to be found]], [[a shortage of serotonin in the brain has not yet been found in depression patients]], and [[gene expression is highly contingent on the environment]]. So for psychiatry too, [[the word "normal" has always been elusive]].

We still do not have a single laboratory test in psychiatry. Because there is always more variability in the results within the [[mental disorder]] category than between it and “normal” or with other [[mental disorder]]s, none of the promising biological findings has ever qualified as a diagnostic test. The [[brain]] has provided us no low-hanging fruit—thousands of studies on hundreds of putative biological markers have so far come up empty. As Roger Sperry put it in his Nobel Prize in Medicine acceptance speech: “The more we learn, the more we recognize the unique complexity of any one individual intellect, the stronger the conclusion becomes that the individuality inherent in our [[brain]] networks makes that of fingerprints or facial features gross and simple by comparison.” Teasing out the heterogeneous underlying mechanisms of [[mental disorder]] will be the work of lifetimes. There will not be one pathway to [[schizophrenia]]; there may be dozens, perhaps hundreds or thousands.
