These notes make it possible to offload a massive amount of information while demonstrating "perfect recall" when needed. The goal of a mind sweep is to identify everything that requires your attention or has the possibility of seeping into and affecting other parts of your life. These include things that are stealing your focus, not letting you get your work done properly, etc.

When you identify these things, you will realize that there are things in your head that you haven't been doing anything about. More often than not, this is related to some level of incompletion or procrastination. As long as things keep accumulating, there's no way they will get done. You can start to progress through these actions with a mind sweep.
