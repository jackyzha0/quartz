## Scientism  #⏳

Scientism is the opinion that science and the scientific method are the best or only way to render truth about the world and reality, and that all other sources of knowledge are meaningless or irrational. While the term was defined originally to mean "methods and attitudes typical of or attributed to natural scientists", some scholars also adopted it as a pejorative term with the meaning "an exaggerated trust in the efficacy of the methods of natural science applied to all areas of investigation (as in philosophy, the social sciences, and the humanities)". The term has often been used to describe the dogmatic endorsement of scientific methods and the reduction of all knowledge to only that which is measured or confirmatory.
