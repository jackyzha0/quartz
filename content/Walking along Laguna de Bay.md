On the late afternoon of May 4, 2021 (Tuesday), coming from Calamba, I decided to get off earlier at Baybayin and see if I can finally get to Laguna Lake’s shore. Among all the barangays I mentioned above, it has a street that goes directly to the shore: Burgos Street. I followed the map and I finally got to see the shore.

On the late afternoon of May 7, 2021 (Friday), I returned to the lake but visiting it through a new shore, on a basketball court at the tip of Mayondon.

Seeing Laguna Lake both gladdened and saddened me. I was glad—very glad—that I heard waves again, that I felt that strong wind once more, that I saw the sunset in its most majestic form. But I was also deeply saddened because I realized that I felt, for the first time in what seems like a very long time, the emotions that the pandemic has deprived me—emotions I didn’t even know I was looking for.

Isolation may indeed be saving our lives, but that kind of life we are saving is not a full life. A full life needs the outdoors. And even if I was already frequently outdoors during the quarantines, I now see that those were not enough. Mountains, seas, roads, ridges—they’re all waiting for us.

During the old normal, it was already too difficult for many of us to see the beauty that is always around us. The pandemic did not make that any easier.

It did not just isolate us from each other. It isolated us from the planet, from the simple things that could bring us great joy.
