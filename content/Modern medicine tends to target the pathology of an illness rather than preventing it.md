## Modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it  # 

In 1940, [[Albert Alexander]], a London constable, was the first human to receive a dose of [[penicillin]] for an acute facial infection that had spread to multiple abscesses and claimed his [[eye]]. Left untreated, it would have been fatal. His response to the medication was “remarkable.” But it didn’t last—the infection relapsed within six months, and Alexander died a year later. Nonetheless, the “Golden Age” of Modern Medicine was launched, and medical [[reductionism]] took hold. Therapy targeted to the pathology. The right [[antibiotic]] could kill the right bacteria, and people got better. Screw prevention, which takes time, infrastructure, and investment. Now you could achieve cure. There’s a pill for that. Targeted therapy via personal intervention became the unyielding goal of Modern Medicine. I find this characteristic of [[left hemisphere]] cognition in that it involves a narrow [[spotlight consciousness]], which results in [[reductionism]], as well as how [[The left hemisphere sees things abstracted, isolated, and stripped of context]]. Also, the [[The right hemisphere sees the whole first, and then the left hemisphere separates it into parts]].

That first Golden Age of Modern Medicine didn’t last even a decade. In 1947, four years after mass production of [[penicillin]], the first bacterial species to develop resistance to the antibiotic reared its ugly head. And so the race was on to develop the next antibiotic—[[methicillin]]. And on and on. Since then, we’ve continued to chase the concept of targeted therapy, we think we have it within our sites, and yet cures continue to elude us. Here, we can also see how [[when solving problems, the left hemisphere tends to rely on a single solution that fits what it already knows]]. We’ve now reached critical mass—of drug-resistant bacteria, that is. There are so many resistant species that they now can share intelligence; that is, they can transfer resistance [[gene]]s between species; a Rise of the Resistance that would terrify all minions of the Empire. Our current crop of antibiotics is coming close to being useless. Add that to the fact that viral diseases are now even more dangerous and harder to control than bacteria ever were, as exemplified first by [[HIV]] in 1979, hantavirus in 1993, Ebola in 2014, and coronavirus in 2020. Even so, these aren’t even the biggest problems with Modern Medicine.

We believe we’re in a new Golden Age of Modern Medicine, as we now use high-tech screening of drugs, Big Data informatics, and [[gene]]tic editing like [[CRISPR-Cas9]] in an attempt to target therapy to the individual and the pathology. For certain [[gene]]tic diseases, such therapies that are targeted to the pathology will likely result in actual “cure.” And that’s great—for these one in ten thousand to one hundred thousand diseases. We’re even looking to use viruses to program an individual’s own immune [[cell]]s to kill [[cancer]]s in that same individual—the ultimate targeted therapy. We’re using robotics and cyberknives to reach surgical outcomes previously unimagined. At UCSF, researchers are harvesting [[stem cell]]s from individuals with type 1 [[diabetes]], using [[growth factor]]s to differentiate them into [[pancreas|pancreatic]] [[beta-cells]] in a petri dish, and then injecting them back into the patient to attempt to cure their [[diabetes]]. It’s true that patients who previously had no hope now have hope. Which is absolutely great—for those patients, and only if they can afford these treatments.
