## The word "the" can be seen as a metaphor # 

In speaking of how [[language can be seen as a kind of metaphor]], consider the word "the." The word assumes that the world is divided in the same way our minds divide it, and it seems a very hypnotic metaphor indeed. In terms of human tragedy and suffering, think of what has been provoked by generalizations such as "the Jews" or "the Blacks." More subtly, remember that the phrase "the length of the rod" seemed to be a perfectly reasonable and objective phrase until [[Albert Einstein|Einstien]] demonstated that a rod has various lengths depending on the velocity of it and also depending on the relative velocity of the person measuring it.
