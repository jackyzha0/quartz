## Introduction

Mabuya is a minimal Zola theme focused on helping you build an elegant, fast, lightweight, and SEO-ready blog.

While searching for themes, I came across [Zola Tale](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola). Sadly, the project's last update was almost 2 years ago on Dec 4, 2021. I forked the project to add my own touches to it.

## Where The Name Comes From

The name Mabuya comes from the [Mabuya hispaniolae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabuya_hispaniolae?useskin=vector), a possibly extinct[^1] species of skink endemic to the Dominican Republic, my home country.

## Features and Improvements

While working on the theme, I have added new functionality and many quality of life improvements. Here's a short non-inclusive list:

* Fully refactored stylesheets.
* Added Dark theme and color scheme toggle.
* Added new footer navigation.
* Created a custom GitHub Action that is faster than any other in GitHub.
* Refined page transitions from desktop to mobile and viceversa.
* Centralized custom variables. Made it easier to make color changes to the site.
* Addressed PR [#7](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/pull/7).
* Addressed (temporarily) Issue [#1](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/issues/1).
* Addressed Issue [#4](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/issues/4).
* Optimized for speed and Accesibility.
* And many other small improvements.
