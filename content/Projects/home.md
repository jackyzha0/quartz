I assign each project a difficulty level out of the following list:
- #difficulty-easy
- #difficulty-moderate
- #difficulty-advanced
## Productivity
- Anything hosted on [[Projects/my-cloud|My Cloud]].
- My primary note-taker, [[Projects/Obsidian/home|obsidian.md]].
- My operating system and the tools within [[Projects/my-computer|my computer]].

## Other Open-Source Contributions
- [[Projects/zotero-lexis-plus|A Lexis+ translator for Zotero.]]
