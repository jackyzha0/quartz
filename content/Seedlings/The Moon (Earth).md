Earth's only natural satellite. Orbits around the Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi).

The usual English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply _Moon_. Occasionally, the name **Luna** is used in scientific writing and science fiction to distinguish our moon from others. **Cynthia** is another poetic name, though rare, for the Moon personified as a goddess, while **Selene** (literally "Moon") is the Greek goddess of the Moon.
