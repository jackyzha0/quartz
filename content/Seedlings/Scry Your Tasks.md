To _scry_ is to see or predict the future by means of a crystal ball. It is also the ability to look at the top cards of your deck and rearrange them in Magic the Gathering. This note was inspired by [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) [Episode 142](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/142) where Myke and Grey discuss scrying your task lists.

In terms of organization, scrying your task list allows you to determine what is the order of 2 to 5 things that _need_ to happen.

Your job is not to get through all the to-do items, but to arrange them in the _correct order_. Sometimes you need to put some things at the bottom of the list. I draw the line when I can't finish the work day until these tasks are _done_.

Don't confuse mission-critical items and time saving tasks. Mission-critical Items **NEED** to be done today. Optionally, anything that will save time the next day **SHOULD** be done the day prior.

You are _probably_ doing life wrong if you consistently get to the bottom of your to-do list. Let me elaborate, if your to-do list is empty, something about your life _is_ wrong. You are not being ambitious enough.
