## The three wholesome roots  #⏳ 

The three wholesome roots are three underlying motives that lead to [[wholesome kamma]]. They are the opposite of [[the three unwholesome roots]]. These include:

- generosity
- [[loving-kindness]]

Which are perpetuated by the third wholesome root:

- wisdom (knowledge of [[the four nobel truths]])

I believe the three wholesome roots to involve the [[right hemisphere]], as [[the right hemisphere is responsible for our capacity for emotional understanding]].
