## # How an AI Learns

There are several forms an AI can learn 

| method                   | explanation                                                                                                           | example               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Supervised Learning      | Learning with labeled data; predicting outcomes based on known examples (e.g., image classification, spam detection). | image classification  |
| Unsupervised Learning    | Learning without labeled data; finding patterns and structure in data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).   | recommendation System | 
| Reinforcement Learning   | Learning through feedback                                                                                                                      | Roboter               |
| Generative Ai | Learning through statistics - finds data                                                                                                                      | ChatGPT               |

## # Supervised-Learning

while creating this ML model - there is a supervision **training & feedback**

several phases
- training phase - feed the ml-system with data
- model is trained with data
- learning takes place through `epochs` (learns a bit --> feedback --> improves for next time)

#### # Example

Dad teaches child how to swim in pool. The child learns to swim gradually after many sessions based on regular feedback from his dad.

---
## # Unsupervised-Learning

no supervision for this ML model

facts
- no trainings 
- model is fed with data - has to learn & find patterns/realtionships by itself

#### # Example

There is no dad to supervise here. The child simply jumps into the pool and has to learn swimming on its own.

## # Supervised- vs Unsupervised- Learning

#### Supervised model

- data has output label
- learns mapping between input & output
	- based on feedback

#### Unsupervised Training

- data has no output label
- model learns pattern/relationship without any feedback

#### # Example

## # Sub-Categories

#### Supervised Learning
2 main subcategories

- **Regression**
- **Classification**

#### Unsupervised Learning
3 main subcategories

- **Clustering**
