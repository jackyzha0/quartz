CHAPTER EIGHT

Successful Protocols Suppressed

190

for the past 60 years the pharmaceutical industry has progressively increased its push to have the public believe that vaccinations are the way to prevent infectious disease. As noted in chapter 7, the World Health Organization has now gone so far as to redefine herd immunity to imply that vaccines are required to protect us from viral illnesses, completely erasing the very mention of the human immune system and the crucial role it plays.

Note: I thought they stimulate the immune system?

190

The push for mandatory vaccine use radically accelerated with the implementation of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which granted drug makers partial liability protection for harm caused by vaccine products. The law was historic acknowledgment by the US government that federally licensed and recommended and state-mandated childhood vaccines can cause injury and death. It created a federal vaccine injury compensation program as an administrative alternative to a lawsuit for parents who did not want to go to court to sue drug companies or doctors.

190

Then, over a period of 30 years, the law was amended by Congress and by federal agencies through rule-making authority, gutting the law’s informing, recording, reporting, and research provisions secured by parents in the legislation and making federal compensation almost impossible to obtain so fewer vaccine-injured people could get compensated.

191

In 2011 the US Supreme Court in a split decision in Bruesewitz v. Wyeth, with Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissenting, effectively removed all remaining liability from vaccine manufacturers for harm caused by vaccines in the US. From 2011 forward, vaccine manufacturers would not be liable for vaccine injuries and deaths, even if there was evidence the company could have made a vaccine less likely to cause harm.

191

Drug companies have been fined tens of billions of dollars in damages for side effects of the drugs they manufacture, so this complete liability protection for government-recommended and state-mandated vaccines is an important part of their financial success.

191

With COVID-19, the liability protection has expanded even further and has completely shielded them from having to pay for vaccine injuries under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP).

191

The first COVID-19 vaccines to be rolled out were experimental messenger RNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which were granted an emergency-use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administation (FDA) in December 2020 to be distributed in the US; they were also released in the U.K. and Canada. The “Sputnik” COVID-19 vaccine was distributed in Russia. While these new coronavirus vaccines have received a lot of positive press, there are several serious safety concerns that remain yet to be addressed.

191

Administering experimental vaccines to millions of people when there is only limited short-term safety data available because they have been fast-tracked to market is beyond reckless. Absolutely no long-term safety studies have been done to assess whether they might cause seizures, cancer, heart disease, allergies, and/or autoimmune diseases, all of which have been observed with other vaccines and were reported in earlier coronavirus vaccine trials on animals.

192

Animal studies were bypassed entirely for COVID-19 vaccines due to fast-tracking in the US government’s Operation Warp Speed program launched in early 2020. As a result, millions of humans—with all sorts of underlying conditions that might render them more prone to vaccine reactions and permanent damage or even death—have now become the primary test subjects.

192

Researchers have been trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-1) outbreak in 2002. None of them have succeeded, and many have demonstrated serious, sometimes fatal, side effects. It’s also important to remember that mRNA vaccines have never before been licensed for use in humans. There is no data in humans studied over time that might give us an indication about what types of long-term effects from COVID-19 vaccines we can expect in years to come. To expect these experimental fast-tracked coronavirus vaccines to succeed when others that have been tested over far longer periods of time have failed miserably is pure folly.

192

Vaccine Effectiveness Vastly Overstated

192

In early November 2020 Pfizer sent the stock market soaring when it announced that analysis of clinical trial data showed the efficacy of its vaccine was more than 90 percent. Soon after, an efficacy rate of 95 percent was announced.1 Moderna boasted similar success with a 94.5 percent efficacy rating in its clinical trials.2 However, the definition of efficacy is not being discussed.

193

If you read Pfizer’s and Moderna’s press releases and other clinical trial information, you’ll see they’ve left out some really crucial information. For example:3

They don’t specify the cycle threshold used for the PCR tests they base their COVID-19 case count on, which is crucial for determining the accuracy of those tests.

They don’t mention anything about hospitalizations or deaths.

There is no information about whether the vaccines prevent asymptomatic infection with and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; if the vaccine efficacy rate only prevents moderate to severe symptomatic disease and not infection and transmission, it will be impossible to achieve herd immunity using the vaccine.

There is no indication about how long protection against moderate to severe symptomatic disease lasts. Some researchers suggest frequent booster doses will be required, perhaps every three to six months or annually.

Number Required to Vaccinate to Prevent One Case

193

In a letter to the editor published by the BMJ, Dr. Allan Cunningham, a retired pediatrician in New York, pointed out that Pfizer’s effectiveness rating fails to tell the story in a way that people can actually understand, and went on to estimate the number needed to vaccinate for Pfizer’s vaccine. This number gives you a much clearer picture of what you can expect (emphasis ours):

Specific data are not given but it is easy enough to approximate the numbers involved, based on the 94 cases in a trial that has enrolled about 40,000 subjects: 8 cases in a vaccine group of 20,000 and 86 cases in a placebo group of 20,000.

This yields a COVID-19 attack rate of 0.0004 in the vaccine group and 0.0043 in the placebo group. Relative risk (RR) for vaccination = 0.093, which translates into a “vaccine effectiveness” of 90.7% [100(1 − 0.093)]. This sounds impressive, but the absolute risk reduction for an individual is only about 0.4% (0.0043 − 0.0004 = 0.0039).

The Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV) = 256 (1/0.0039), which means that to prevent just one COVID-19 case 256 individuals must get the vaccine; the other 255 individuals derive no benefit, but are subject to vaccine adverse effects, whatever they may be and whenever we learn about them.4

297

4.   Allen S. Cunningham, MD, November 13, 2020, comment on Elisabeth Mahase, “Covid-19: Vaccine Candidate May Be More than 90% Effective, Interim Results Indicate,” BMJ 2020, no. 371 (2020): m4347, https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m4347

194

In an article published by the Mises Institute, Dr. Gilbert Berdine, associate professor of medicine at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, helps explain this statistical manipulation by performing the same calculation for the Moderna vaccine (emphasis ours):

The Pfizer study had 43,538 participants and was analyzed after 164 cases. So, roughly 150 out 21,750 participants (less than 0.7%) became PCR positive in the control group and about one-tenth that number in the vaccine group became PCR positive.

The Moderna trial had 30,000 participants. There were 95 “cases” in the 15,000 control participants (about 0.6%) and five “cases” in the 15,000 vaccine participants (about one-twentieth of 0.6%). The “efficacy” figures quoted in these announcements are odds ratios …

When the risks of an event are small, odds ratios can be misleading about absolute risk. A more meaningful measure of efficacy would be the number [needed] to vaccinate to prevent one hospitalization or one death. Those numbers are not available.

An estimate of the number [needed] to treat from the Moderna trial to prevent a single “case” would be 15,000 vaccinations to prevent 90 “cases” or 167 vaccinations per “case” prevented, which does not sound nearly as good as 94.5% effective.5

297

5.   Berdine, “What the Covid Vaccine Hype Fails to Mention.”

195

Another important data point shielded from the public is the absolute risk reduction provided by these vaccines. The drug companies are experts in confusing physicians and the public by conflating absolute and relative risks. They have previously done this in spades with statin drugs and made tens if not hundreds of billions in profits. In a November 26, 2020, BMJ article, Peter Doshi, associate editor of the journal, pointed out that while Pfizer claims its vaccine has a 95 percent efficacy rate, this is the relative risk reduction. The absolute risk reduction is actually less than 1 percent.6

297

6.   Peter Doshi, “Pfizer and Moderna’s 95% Effective Vaccines—Let’s Be Cautious and First See the Full Data,” BMJ Opinion, November 26, 2020, https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/11/26/peter-doshi-pfizer-and-modernas-95-effective-vaccines-lets-be-cautious-and-first-see-the-full-data/

195

In a later article Doshi presented yet additional concerns.7 For starters he points out that Pfizer did not consistently confirm whether test subjects who showed symptoms of COVID-19 were actually PCR-positive. Instead, a large portion of them were simply marked as “suspected COVID-19.” The problem with this is that the 95 percent efficacy rating is based on PCR-confirmed cases only.

297

7.   Doshi, “Pfizer and Moderna’s 95% Effective Vaccines.”

195

Since the data show there are 20 times more suspected cases than confirmed cases, the relative risk reduction may actually be as low as 19 percent, Doshi said, which is far below the 50 percent efficacy required for use authorization by regulators. What’s more, if suspected cases occurred in people who had false negative PCR test results, then the vaccine’s efficacy would be even lower.

195

Yet another data point that might have a bearing on Pfizer’s efficacy rate was the exclusion of 371 participants from its efficacy analysis due to “important protocol deviations on or prior to 7 days after Dose 2.” Of those, 311 were from the vaccine group while only 60 were in the placebo group.

195

Why were five times as many in the vaccine group excluded from the efficacy analysis than in the placebo group? And what exactly were these “protocol deviations” that caused them to be excluded? This is called stacking the deck so the results can be manipulated in the desired direction to “prove” efficacy, when it is merely a statistical manipulation.

196

Will COVID-19 Vaccine Save Lives, Reduce Hospitalizations, or Prevent Transmission?

196

Doshi has also pointed out that current trials are not designed to tell us whether the vaccines will actually save lives. And if they don’t, are they really worth the risks that might be involved? “What will it mean exactly when a vaccine is declared ‘effective’?,” he asks in his November 26 article. “To the public this seems fairly obvious. ‘The primary goal of a COVID-19 vaccine is to keep people from getting very sick and dying,’ a National Public Radio broadcast said bluntly … Yet the current phase III trials are not actually set up to prove either. None of the trials [were] designed to detect a reduction in any serious outcome such as hospital admissions, use of intensive care, or deaths.”8

196

Nor do the trials tell us anything about the vaccine’s ability to prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission, as this would require testing volunteers twice a week for long periods of time—a strategy that is “operationally untenable,” according to Tal Zaks, chief medical officer at Moderna.9

Major Safety Questions Still Remain

196

Aside from the question of whether the COVID-19 vaccines work as advertised, a number of safety questions also remain. And when it comes to safety, it’s important to understand that only a few thousand verified healthy volunteers were exposed to the actual vaccine. The real beta testers are those who are lining up to take the vaccines when they first become available.

196

A rather extraordinarily long list of safety questions can be made, starting with: “What effect will RNA vaccines have on DNA?” According to a January 29, 2020, Phys.org article, research has shown RNA does have a “direct effect on DNA stability.”10

298

10.   Eyrun Thune, “Modified RNA Has a Direct Effect on DNA,” Phys.org, January 29, 2020, https://phys.org/news/2020-01-rna-effect-dna.html.

196

Might COVID-19 vaccines disrupt genes, and if so, which ones? This could be a rather crucial detail. As just one example, when genes that are important for the chemical compound 6-methyladenine are eliminated, neurodegeneration has been shown to occur in both mice and humans.11

298

11.   Thune, “Modified RNA Has a Direct Effect on DNA.”

197

Another safety question involves the lipid nanoparticles used in the vaccines. In 2017 Stat News discussed Moderna’s challenges in developing an mRNA-based drug for Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a condition that can lead to jaundice, muscle degeneration, and brain damage:

In order to protect mRNA molecules from the body’s natural defenses, drug developers must wrap them in a protective casing. For Moderna, that meant putting its Crigler-Najjar therapy in nanoparticles made of lipids. And for its chemists, those nanoparticles created a daunting challenge: Dose too little, and you don’t get enough enzyme to affect the disease; dose too much, and the drug is too toxic for patients.

From the start, Moderna’s scientists knew that using mRNA to spur protein production would be a tough task, so they scoured the medical literature for diseases that might be treated with just small amounts of additional protein. “And that list of diseases is very, very short,” said the former employee …

Crigler-Najjar was the lowest-hanging fruit. Yet Moderna could not make its therapy work … The safe dose was too weak, and repeat injections of a dose strong enough to be effective had troubling effects on the liver in animal studies.12

197

So are the lipid nanoparticles used in today’s COVID-19 vaccines any safer than the ones deemed too dangerous for human trials a few years ago? As we’ll review later on in this chapter, anaphylactic reactions emerged as one of the first widely occurring side effects, and this could potentially be related to these nanoparticles. Since the mRNA are rapidly degraded, they must be complexed with lipids or polymers.

The COVID-19 vaccines use PEGylated lipid nanoparticles, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) is known to cause anaphylaxis.13 The risk of autoimmune challenges also looms large.

198

In his article Berdine points out that “colleagues are concerned about possible autoimmune side effects that may not appear for months after vaccination.” It’s worth noting that none of the trials included immunocompromised volunteers, so the effects of these vaccines on people with suppressed immune function is wholly unknown.

198

This is a significant problem, seeing how an estimated 14.7 million to 23.5 million Americans suffer from some form of autoimmune disease,14 and these people are also at increased risk for COVID-19 complications and death. If the vaccine exacerbates autoimmune problems, the outcome could be devastating for an extraordinary number of people.

Vaccine-Induced Paradoxical Immune Reactions Could Spell Disaster

198

If previous trials of coronavirus vaccines are any indication, there is plenty to be worried about when it comes to the potential for serious side effects from COVID-19 vaccines. A frequent problem found in those studies was antibody-dependent immune enhancement—something we’ve known about since the 1960s. In a nutshell, this is when a viral vaccine renders you more prone to severe disease and death if subsequently you are infected with the virus.

198

As explained by James Odell, OMD, ND, L.Ac. in a December 28, 2020, Bioregulatory Medicine Institute article:

Over a span of 18 years there have been numerous coronavirus vaccine animal studies conducted, which unfortunately demonstrated significant and serious side-effects. Either the animals were not completely protected, became severely ill with accelerated autoimmune conditions, or died.

Animal side effects and deaths were primarily attributed to what is called Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) … Virus ADE is a biochemical mechanism in which virus-specific antibodies (usually from a vaccine) promote the entry and/or the replication of another virus into white cells such as monocytes/macrophages and granulocytic cells.

This then modulates an overly strong immune response (abnormally enhances it) and induces chronic inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or a “cytokine storm,” one or more of which have been reported to cause severe illness and even death. Essentially, ADE is a disease dissemination cycle causing individuals with secondary infection to be more immunologically upregulated than during their first infection (or prior vaccination) by a different strain.

ADE of disease is always a concern for the development of vaccines and antibody therapies because the mechanisms that underlie antibody protection against any virus has a theoretical potential to amplify the infection or trigger harmful immunopathology. ADE of the viral entry has been observed and its mechanism described for many viruses including coronaviruses.

Basically, it was shown that antibodies target one serotype of viruses but only sub neutralize another, leading to ADE of the latter exposed viruses … Because ADE has been demonstrated in animals, coronavirus vaccine research never progressed to human trials, at least not till the recent SARS coronavirus-2 fast-track campaign.15

298

15.   Odell, “COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines.”

199

The risk of antibody-dependent immune enhancement, also known as paradoxical immune enhancement (PIE), was highlighted in the paper “Informed Consent Disclosure to Vaccine Trial Subjects of Risk of COVID-19 Vaccine Worsening Clinical Disease,” published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice, October 28, 2020. “COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies may sensitize vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated,” the paper states, adding:

Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: Vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralizing antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).16

200

Previous Coronavirus Vaccine Tests Were Flagged for Safety Risks

200

This risk, however, was not communicated to Pfizer and Moderna clinical trial participants. If one or more COVID-19 vaccines turn out to cause this type of immune enhancement, we could be looking at an avalanche of critical illnesses and deaths as people start being exposed to any number of mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains.

200

The saddest part is that this information was known, yet suppressed. In May 2020 I interviewed Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., about this very issue, at which time he provided the following story:

Coronavirus vaccine development began after three SARS epidemics had broken out, starting in early 2002. The Chinese, the Americans, the Europeans all got together and said, “We need to develop a vaccine against coronavirus.” Around 2012, they had about 30 vaccines that looked promising.

They took the four best of those and manufactured the vaccines. They gave those vaccines to ferrets, which are the closest analogy when you’re looking at lung infections in human beings.

The ferrets had an extraordinarily good antibody response, and that is the metric by which FDA licenses vaccines. So they thought, “We hit the jackpot.” All four of these vaccines worked like a charm. Then something terrible happened. Those ferrets were then exposed to the wild virus, developed inflammation in all their organs, their lungs stopped functioning.

The scientists remembered that the same thing had happened in the 1960s when they tried to develop an RSV vaccine, which is an upper respiratory illness very similar to coronavirus. At the time, they did not test it on animals.

They went right to human testing. They tested it on about 35 children, and the same thing happened. The children developed a champion antibody response, robust, durable. It looked perfect, and then the children were exposed to the wild virus and they all became sick. Two of them died. They abandoned the vaccine. It was a big embarrassment to FDA and NIH.

Those scientists in 2012 remembered that, so, they looked closer and they realized that there are two kinds of antibodies being produced by the coronavirus. There are neutralizing antibodies, which are the kind you want, which fight the disease, and then there are binding antibodies.

The binding antibodies actually create a pathway for the disease in your body, and they trigger something called a paradoxical immune response or paradoxical immune enhancement. What that means is that it looks good until you get the disease, and then it makes the disease much, much worse. Coronavirus vaccines can be very dangerous, and that’s why even our enemies, people who hate you and me—Peter Hotez, Paul Offit, Ian Lipkin—are all saying, “You got to be really, really careful with this vaccine.”

201

Early Trials Raised Concerns About mRNA Vaccine Side Effects

201

Now that the first batches of COVID-19 vaccine have been rolled out, we’re starting to see a number of worrying effects, and there was cause for concern from the very start of Moderna’s phase 1 trials, when 80 percent of participants in the 100 microgram dose group suffered systemic side effects.17

298

16.   Timothy Cardozo and Ronald Veazey, “Informed Consent Disclosure to Vaccine Trial Subjects of Risk of COVID-19 Vaccines Worsening Clinical Disease,” International Journal of Clinical Practice, October 28, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13795.

298

17.   Lisa A. Jackson et al., “An mRNA Vaccine Against SARS-CoV-2—Preliminary Report,” New England Journal of Medicine 383, no. 20 (2020): 1920–31, https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483.

201

After the second dose, 100 percent experienced side effects. Despite that, this was the dosage Moderna chose to move forward with into later-phase trials. (In its highest dosage group, which received 250 mcg, 100 percent of participants suffered side effects after the first dose.)

202

On May 20, 2020, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., warned that “the clinical trial results could not be much worse.” He wrote: “Moderna did not release its clinical trial study or raw data, but its press release, which was freighted with inconsistencies, acknowledged that three volunteers developed Grade 3 systemic events defined by the FDA as ‘Preventing daily activity and requiring medical intervention.’ … A vaccine with those reaction rates could cause grave injuries in 1.5 billion humans if administered to ‘every person on earth.’”

202

To understand why mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are so disconcerting, you need to understand how they’re designed to function. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines both use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to instruct your cells to make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This is the glycoprotein that attaches to the ACE2 receptor of your cells, which allows the virus to actually infect you.

The idea behind these mRNA vaccines is that by creating the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, your immune system will produce antibodies in response. What has not been factored into this treatment is how to shut off the production of these proteins once they aren’t needed. What happens when you turn your body into a viral protein factory, thus keeping antibody production activated on a continual basis with no ability to shut down?

202

Furthermore, as mentioned in Kennedy’s quote, there are two types of antibodies: binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. Binding antibodies are incapable of preventing viral infection. Instead they trigger an exaggerated immune response, as detailed above. In an early press release, Moderna noted that vaccine recipients had binding antibodies “at levels seen in blood samples from people who have recovered from COVID-19.” At the time of that press release, data from 25 of 45 participants showed only this binding antibody result.

203

Meanwhile, neutralizing antibody data were available for only 8 of 45 participants, and the neutralizing antibodies are likely to be the more important, seeing how they are the ones that actually fight infection. Considering the problems caused by binding antibodies in previous coronavirus vaccine trials, these results triggered warning bells.

203

As noted by Robert Kennedy, Jr.:

Moderna did not explain why it reported positive antibody tests for only eight participants. These outcomes are particularly disappointing because the most hazardous hurdle for the inoculation is still ahead; challenging participants with wild COVID infection.

Past attempts at developing COVID vaccines have always faltered at this stage as both humans and animals achieved robust antibody response then sickened and died when exposed to the wild virus.18

203

Later-phase trials have yielded similarly high rates of side effects for Moderna and Pfizer alike. As noted by Doshi back in November 2020: “Moderna’s press release states that 9% experienced grade 3 myalgia and 10% grade 3 fatigue; Pfizer’s statement reported 3.8% experienced grade 3 fatigue and 2% grade 3 headache. Grade 3 adverse events are considered severe, defined as preventing daily activity. Mild and moderate severity reactions are bound to be far more common.”19

298

19.   Doshi, “Pfizer and Moderna’s 95% Effective Vaccines.”

203

On top of all this, while data are still limited, researchers at University of Pennsylvania and Duke University list a number of potential adverse effects from mRNA vaccines, including local and systemic inflammation, stimulation of autoreactive antibodies, autoimmunity, edema (swelling), and blood clots.20

203

Some of these effects, such as systemic inflammation and blood clots, resemble severe symptoms of COVID-19 itself. Might that be an indication that mRNA vaccines can indeed worsen COVID-19 infection and lead to paradoxical immune enhancement reactions similar to the ones that killed the coronavirus-immunized ferrets once they were exposed to the coronavirus?

203

Reported COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effects

204

The most concerning side effect reported in later-stage vaccine trials was transverse myelitis—inflammation of the spinal cord.21 However, now that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have been given to tens of thousands of people with all sorts of underlying conditions, we’re starting to see a much wider range of disturbing effects.

204

Within weeks of the vaccines becoming available (primarily to front-line health care workers and nursing home residents), reports of serious side effects started emerging in popular media and on social media networks. Among them:

Persistent malaise22 and extreme exhaustion.23

Anaphylactic reactions.24

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome.25

Chronic seizures and convulsions.26

Paralysis,27 including cases of Bell’s palsy.28

At least 75 cases of sudden death (55 in the US and 20 in Norway), many occurring within hours or days.29

204

According to a report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, by December 18, 2020, 112,807 Americans had received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Of those, 3,150 suffered one or more “health impact events,” defined as being “unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, required care from doctor or health care professional.” That gives us a side effect rate of 2.79 percent.30

Extrapolated to the total US population of 328.2 million, we may then expect more than 9,156,000 Americans to be injured by the vaccine if every single man, woman, and child is vaccinated. Extrapolated across the global population, the harm will be truly mind-boggling.

One suspected culprit in the allergic reactions people are experiencing is polyethylene glycol. The link appears valid enough that the CDC is warning people with known allergy to PEG or polysorbate to avoid all mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.31

COVID-19 Vaccine Trials Were Rigged

204

While vaccine makers insist that any vaccine reaching the market will have undergone rigorous testing, the design of the trial protocols clearly demonstrates the abandonment of virtually any attempt to confirm human safety.

205

The vaccines received a passing grade even if their efficacy for preventing infection was nonexistent. Preventing infection wasn’t even a criterion for a successful COVID-19 vaccine. The only criterion of success was a reduction of moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms, and even then the reduction required was minimal. In a September 2020 Forbes article, William Haseltine highlighted the questionable end points of these trials: “We all expect an effective vaccine to prevent serious illness if infected. Three of the vaccine protocols—Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca—do not require that their vaccine prevent serious disease only that they prevent moderate symptoms which may be as mild as cough, or headache.”32

300

32.   William A. Haseltine, “Covid-19 Vaccine Protocols Reveal That Trials Are Designed to Succeed,” Forbes, September 23, 2020, https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/09/23/covid-19-vaccine-protocols-reveal-that-trials-are-designed-to-succeed/?sh=2212afc25247.

205

To get a “passing” grade in the limited interim analysis, a vaccine needed to show a 70 percent efficacy. However, this does not mean it will prevent infection in 7 of 10 people. As explained by Haseltine: “For Moderna, the initial interim analysis will be based on the results of infection of only 53 people. The judgment reached in interim analysis is dependent upon the difference in the number of people with symptoms … in the vaccinated group versus the unvaccinated group. Moderna’s success margin is for 13 or less of those 53 to develop symptoms compared to 40 or more in their control group.”

205

The other vaccine makers based their results on a similar protocol, where only a limited number of vaccinated participants are exposed to the virus to evaluate the extent of their moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms.

205

As if that’s not eyebrow-raising enough, the minimum qualification for a “case of COVID-19” amounts to just one positive PCR test and one or two mild symptoms, such as headache, fever, cough, or mild nausea. Basically, all they’re doing is seeing if the COVID-19 vaccines minimize common cold symptoms.

206

There’s no telling whether they will ultimately prevent hospitalizations and deaths. In fact, none of the trials included failure to prevent hospitalization or death as a measure of success. Johnson & Johnson’s trial is the only one that requires at least five severe COVID-19 cases to be included in the interim analysis. Common sense dictates that if the vaccines cannot prevent or reduce infection and transmission, hospitalization, or death, then they cannot possibly end the pandemic.

206

Vaccinations Have Worsened Pandemic Illness in the Past

206

The idea that the COVID-19 vaccine might worsen illness is primarily based on the factors reviewed earlier in this chapter, such as the risk of antibody- dependent immune enhancement. But we can also look to previous vaccination campaigns. There are many studies showing that the seasonal influenza vaccine can actually increase your risk of pandemic influenza, for example.

206

Research raising serious questions about annual flu shots and their impact on pandemic viral illnesses include a 2010 review in PLoS Medicine, which found receiving the seasonal flu vaccine increased people’s risk of getting sick with pandemic H1N1 swine flu, and resulted in more serious complications.33

301

Skowronski et al., “Association Between the 2008–09 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine and Pandemic H1N1 Illness During Spring–Summer 2009: Four Observational Studies from Canada,” PLoS Medicine, April 6, 2010, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000258; Maryn McKenna, “New Canadian Studies Suggest Seasonal Flu Shot Increased H1N1 Risk,” CIDRAP, April 6, 2010, https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2010/04/new-canadian-studies-suggest-seasonal-flu-shot-increased-h1n1-risk.

206

People who received the trivalent influenza vaccine during the 2008–09 flu season were between 1.4 and 2.5 times more likely to get infected with pandemic H1N1 in the spring and summer of 2009 than those who did not get the seasonal flu vaccine. The findings were confirmed by the team in a study done on ferrets. MedPage Today quoted Dr. Danuta Skowronski, a Canadian influenza expert with the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control: “There may be a direct vaccine effect in which the seasonal vaccine induced some cross-reactive antibodies that recognized pandemic H1N1 virus, but those antibodies were at low levels and were not effective at neutralizing the virus. Instead of killing the new virus it actually may facilitate its entry into the cells.”34

In all, five other observational studies conducted across several Canadian provinces found identical results. These findings also confirmed preliminary data from Canada and Hong Kong. As Professor Peter Collignon, an Australian infectious disease expert, told ABC News at the time: “We may be perversely setting ourselves up that if something really new and nasty comes along, that people who have been vaccinated may in fact be more susceptible compared to getting this natural infection.”35

An Astonishing 1 in 40 Are Injured by Vaccines

208

We often hear that vaccine injuries occur at a rate of one in one million. This, however, is a gross underestimation. In a videotaped debate with lawyer Alan Dershowitz on the constitutionality of vaccine mandates, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., discussed an investigation by the US Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).40

301

40.   Dr. Joseph Mercola, “Vaccine Debate—Kennedy Jr. vs Dershowitz,” Mercola.com, August 22, 2020, https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/08/22/the-great-vaccine-debate.aspx

208

They conducted a machine cluster analysis of health data collected from 376,452 individuals who received a total of 1.4 million doses of 45 vaccines. Of these doses, 35,570 vaccine reactions were identified, which means a more accurate estimate of vaccine damage would be 2.6 percent of all vaccinations. This means 1 in 40 people—not 1 in 1 million—are injured by vaccines, and a clinician who administers vaccines will have an average of 1.3 adverse vaccine events per month. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, based on early CDC data, we may be looking at a side effect rate of 2.79 percent for the COVID-19 vaccine. It’s astonishingly close to the 2.6 percent found in this far larger cluster analysis.

209

That vaccines cause injuries is not a hypothetical. As noted by Kennedy, the reason vaccine manufacturers were given immunity in the first place was that they admitted vaccines are unavoidably unsafe and there’s no way to make them 100 percent safe.

209

The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) created under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act has previously paid out over $4 billion to patients permanently damaged or killed by vaccines.

209

If that number wasn’t bad enough, to add insult to injury, that’s just a small portion of all the cases filed in the VICP—less than 1 percent of people who are injured ever get to court, due to the high bar set for proving causation. The risk of vaccine side effects and injuries is particularly troubling in light of the fact that vaccine manufacturers are indemnified against harm that occurs from the use of their federally recommended and state-mandated vaccines.

209

Kennedy (and other health experts) predicts the COVID-19 vaccine may become the greatest public health disaster in history. He says:

You’re going to see a lot of people dropping dead. The problem is, Anthony Fauci put $500 million of our [tax] dollars into that vaccine. He owns half the patents. He has five guys working for him [who are] entitled to collect royalties.

So, you have a corrupt system, and now they’ve got a vaccine that is too big to fail. They’re not saying this was a terrible, terrible mistake. They’re saying, “We’re going to order 2 million doses of this [vaccine]” … And, they have no liability … No medical product in the world would be able to go forward with a [safety] profile like Moderna has.41

Special Court Created Just for Those Injured or Killed by a COVID “Countermeasure”

210

Buried in the March 17, 2020, Federal Register—the daily journal of the US government—in a document titled, “Declaration Under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for Medical Countermeasures Against COVID-19,” is language that establishes a new COVID-19 vaccine court—similar to the federal vaccine court that already exists for injuries and deaths caused by federally recommended vaccines for children and pregnant women.42

302

210

The US vaccine industry operates under a liability shield unlike any other in existence. If virtually any other existing product injures or kills a person, its manufacturer is held accountable in a civil court of law. With FDA-licensed and CDC-recommended vaccines, however, this is not the case.

210

Thirty-five years ago Congress created the federally operated Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Through this, the US Court of Federal Claims in Washington, DC, handles contested vaccine injury and death cases in what has become known as vaccine court. When you sue for a vaccine injury, you’re actually suing the US government, and payouts are paid for by the US public via a small fee tacked on to each vaccine sold.

210

The newly established COVID-19 vaccine court appears largely the same, except instead of focusing on injuries or deaths related to the recommended vaccines for children and pregnant women, it will be centered on those stemming from a new COVID-19 vaccine. Journalist Jon Rappoport highlighted the relevant section in this document, which includes compensation for covered “countermeasures” for COVID-19, such as a vaccine:

Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program … Section 319F-4 of the PHS Act, 42 USC 247d-6e, authorizes the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) to provide benefits to eligible individuals who sustain a serious physical injury or die as a direct result of the administration or use of a Covered [COVID] Countermeasure [for instance, a vaccine].

Compensation under the CICP for an injury directly caused by a Covered Countermeasure is based on the requirements set forth in this Declaration, the administrative rules for the Program, and the statute. To show direct causation between a Covered Countermeasure and a serious physical injury, the statute requires “compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific evidence.”43

302

43.   Jon Rappoport, “Exposed: There’s a New Federal Court to Handle All the Expected COVID Vaccine Injury Claims,” September 22, 2020, https://www.naturalblaze.com/2020/09/exposed-theres-a-new-federal-court-to-handle-all-the-expected-covid-vaccine-injury-claims.html.

211

Compensation has been notoriously difficult to obtain from the existing vaccine court, and getting money from the CICP will likely be even more difficult, considering virtually all side effects are routinely dismissed as coincidental, and proving “direct causation” when we know virtually nothing about how mRNA vaccines affect human biology may be next to impossible.

211

Meanwhile, vaccine makers have nothing to lose by marketing their experimental shots, even if they cause serious injury and death. As Rappoport’s tongue-in-cheek statement suggests:

“We know—and don’t ask us how—that millions of you are going to get headaches. To prevent that, we’re going to hit all of you on the head with a very heavy sledgehammer. If, ahem, a few of you happen to sustain an injury or die, we have a court where your relatives can try to get money out of us. By the way, in this court, we’ll do everything we can to deny you money. Good luck.” Yes, the government knows exactly what’s coming when they approve a COVID vaccine. And now, so do you.44

Do We Really Need a COVID-19 Vaccine?

212

A large amount of data strongly suggests the COVID-19 vaccine may be completely unnecessary, which means the global population is being bamboozled into participating in a dangerous and unprecedented experiment for no good reason whatsoever. For example:

212

COVID-19 mortality is extremely low outside of nursing homes—99.7 percent of people recover from COVID-19. If you’re under 60 years of age, your chance of dying from seasonal influenza is greater than your chance of dying from COVID-19.45

212

As covered in chapter 5, data clearly show that COVID-19 has not resulted in excess mortality, meaning the same number of people who die in any given year, on average, have died in this year of the pandemic.46

212

As we’ll explore in the next section, multiple studies suggest that immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection is more widespread than suspected, thanks to cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses that cause the common cold.

212

It is unclear whether asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 are more or less likely to spread SARS-CoV-2. A study looking at PCR test data from nearly 10 million residents in Wuhan city found that not a single one of those who had been in close contact with an asymptomatic individual (someone who tested positive but had no symptoms) had been infected with the virus. In all instances, virus cultures from people who tested positive but had no symptoms also came up negative for live virus.47

212

Most Are Already Immune to SARS-CoV-2 Infection

212

It’s important to realize you have two types of immunity. Your innate immune system is primed and ready to immediately attack foreign invaders at any moment and is your first line of defense. Your adaptive immune system, on the other hand, “remembers” previous exposure to a pathogen and mounts a delayed but more permanent long-term response when a previous encountered infection is recognized.48

302

48.   Khan Academy, “Adaptive Immunity,” accessed January 22, 2021, https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/organ-systems/the-immune-system/a/adaptive-immunity.

213

Your adaptive immune system is further divided into two arms: humoral immunity (B cells) and cell-mediated immunity (T cells). The B cells and T cells are manufactured as needed from specialized stem cells.

213

If you have never been previously exposed to a disease but are given antibodies from someone who was and become ill and then recover, you can acquire humoral immunity against that disease. Your humoral immune system can also become activated if there’s cross-reactivity with another similar pathogen. As you can see from the list below, in the case of COVID-19, evidence suggests exposure to other coronaviruses that cause the common cold can confer immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

213

Cell, June 2020—This study found that 70 percent of samples from patients who had recovered from mild cases of COVID-19 had resistance to SARS-CoV-2 on the T cell level. Importantly, 40 to 60 percent of people who had not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 also had resistance to the virus on the T cell level.49

According to the authors, this suggests there’s “cross-reactive T cell recognition between circulating ‘common cold’ coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2.” In other words, if you’ve recovered from a common cold caused by a particular coronavirus, your humoral immune system may activate when you encounter SARS-CoV-2, thus rendering you resistant to COVID-19.

Nature Immunology, September 2020—This German study, much like the Cell study above, found that “Cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 peptides revealed pre-existing T cell responses in 81 percent of unexposed individuals and validated similarity with common cold coronaviruses, providing a functional basis for heterologous immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection.”50

The term heterologous immunity refers to immunity that develops against a given pathogen after you’ve been exposed to a non-identical pathogen. In other words, even among those who were unexposed, 81 percent were resistant or immune to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

214

The Lancet Microbe, September 2020—This study found that rhinovirus infection, responsible for the common cold, largely prevented concurrent influenza infection by triggering the production of natural antiviral interferon.51

The researchers speculate that the common cold virus could potentially help protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. Interferon is part of your early immune response, and its protective effects last for at least five days, according to the researchers. Co-author Dr. Ellen Foxman told UPI:

This may explain why the flu season, in winter, generally occurs after the common cold season, in autumn, and why very few people have both viruses at the same time. Our results show that interactions between viruses can be an important driving force dictating how and when viruses spread through a population.

Since every virus is different, we still do not know how the common cold season will impact the spread of COVID-19, but we now know we should be looking out for these interactions.52

Nature, July 2020—This Singaporean study found that common colds caused by the betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 might make you more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that the resulting immunity could be long lasting. Patients who recovered from SARS infection back in 2003 still had T cell reactivity to the N protein of SARS-CoV now, 17 years later. These patients also had strong cross-reactivity to the N protein of SARS-CoV-2.

The authors suggest that if you’ve beaten a common cold caused by OC43 or HKU1 betacoronavirus in the past, you may have a 50/50 chance of having defensive T cells that can recognize and help defend against SARS-CoV-2.53

Cell, August 2020—This Swedish study found that exposed individuals, even if they tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, still had SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells that may provide long-term immune protection against COVID-19.54 As explained by the authors:

Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative exposed family members and convalescent individuals with a history of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits broadly directed and functionally replete memory T cell responses, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19.55

Additional support for the idea that herd immunity may already have been achieved in most countries comes from statisticians working with mathematical models. For example, as early as June 2020, Professor Karl Friston, a statistician, claimed that immunity against SARS-CoV-2, globally, could be as high as 80 percent.56

303

56.   Freddie Sayers, “Karl Friston: Up to 80% Not Even Susceptible to Covid-19,” Unherd.com, June 4, 2020, https://unherd.com/2020/06/karl-friston-up-to-80-not-even-susceptible-to-covid-19/.

215

Friston’s model also effectively vaporizes claims that social distancing is necessary, because once sensible behaviors such as staying home when sick are entered into it, the positive effect of lockdown efforts on “flattening the curve” simply vanish. In all likelihood, the global lockdowns were completely unnecessary, and certainly should not continue.

215

There’s also data showing that up to 80 percent of people tested at clinics have COVID-19 antibodies (meaning they’re immune), and while rates may be lower among the general population, it’s quite likely that herd immunity already exists among certain populations. In a survey of random households in Mumbai, up to 58 percent of residents in poor areas had antibodies, compared with up to 17 percent in the rest of the city.57

215

Now, if it’s true that a majority already have some measure of immunity against COVID-19 due to previous exposure to other coronaviruses, then we’ve probably already reached the threshold for natural herd immunity, and vaccinating every human on the planet (or close to it) is completely unnecessary. What’s more, the threshold for herd immunity may be far lower than previously suspected, which makes global inoculation even less of a necessity.

215

Herd Immunity Threshold for COVID-19 Could Be Under 10 Percent

216

Initial estimates by health officials were that 70 to 80 percent of the population would need to be immune before herd immunity would be achieved. Now more than a dozen scientists claim that the herd immunity threshold is likely below 50 percent.

216

Herd immunity is calculated using reproductive number, or R-naught (R0), which is the estimated number of new infections that may occur from one infected person.58 R0 of below 1 (with R1 meaning that one person who’s infected is expected to infect one other person) indicates that cases are declining while R0 above 1 suggests cases are on the rise.

It’s far from an exact science, however, as a person’s susceptibility to infection varies depending on many factors, including their health, age, and contacts within a community. The initial R0 calculations for COVID-19’s herd immunity threshold were based on assumptions that everyone has the same susceptibility and would be mixing randomly with others in the community.

216

“That doesn’t happen in real life,” Dr. Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, told the New York Times.59 “Herd immunity could vary from group to group, and subpopulation to subpopulation,” or even zip code. When real-world scenarios are factored into the equation, the herd immunity threshold drops significantly, with some experts saying it could be as low as 10 to 20 percent.

Data from Stockholm County, Sweden, shows a herd immunity threshold of 17 percent,60 while researchers from Oxford, Virginia Tech, and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine found that when individual variations in susceptibility and exposure are taken into account, the herd immunity threshold dips below 10 percent.61

In another article that he wrote for Conservative Review, Bostom said:

Naturally acquired herd immunity to COVID-19 combined with earnest protection of the vulnerable elderly—especially nursing home and assisted living facility residents—is an eminently reasonable and practical alternative to the dubious panacea of mass compulsory vaccination against the virus.

This strategy was successfully implemented in Malmo, Sweden, which had few COVID-19 deaths by assiduously protecting its elder care homes, while “schools remained open, residents carried on drinking in bars and cafes, and the doors of hairdressers and gyms were open throughout.”68

Adding support to Bostom’s conclusion that naturally acquired herd immunity is a far better strategy than mandatory vaccination is Tom Britton, a mathematician at Stockholm University, who told the New York Times that since viral infections naturally target the most susceptible during the first wave, “immunity following a wave of infection is distributed more efficiently than with a vaccination campaign …”69

WHO Changes the Meaning of Herd Immunity

217

In June 2020, WHO’s definition of herd immunity, posted on one of their COVID-19 Q&A pages, was in line with the widely accepted concept that has been the standard for infectious diseases for decades. Here’s what it originally said, courtesy of the Internet Archive’s Wayback machine:

Herd immunity is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection.70

305

70.   “Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Serology Q&A,” World Health Organization, June 9, 2020, https://web.archive.org/web/20201101161006/https:/www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-serology.

218

It should be noted that “immunity developed through previous infection” is the way it’s worked since humans have been alive. Apparently, according to WHO, that’s no longer the case. In October 2020, here’s their updated definition of herd immunity, which is now a “concept used for vaccination”:

“Herd immunity”, also known as “population immunity”, is a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached.

Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it.

Vaccines train our immune systems to create proteins that fight disease, known as “antibodies”, just as would happen when we are exposed to a disease but—crucially—vaccines work without making us sick. Vaccinated people are protected from getting the disease in question and passing it on, breaking any chains of transmission. Visit our webpage on COVID-19 and vaccines for more detail.

With herd immunity, the vast majority of a population are vaccinated … lowering the … overall amount of virus able to spread in the whole population. As a result, not every single person needs to be vaccinated to be protected, which helps ensure vulnerable groups who cannot get vaccinated are kept safe. This is called herd immunity.…

The percentage of people who need to have antibodies in order to achieve herd immunity against a particular disease varies with each disease. For example, herd immunity against measles requires 95% of a population to be vaccinated. The remaining 5% will be protected by the fact that measles will not spread among those who are vaccinated. For polio, the threshold is about 80%.

Achieving herd immunity with safe and effective vaccines makes diseases rarer and saves lives.71

219

This perversion of science implies that the only way to achieve herd immunity is via vaccination, which is blatantly untrue. The startling implications for society, however, are that by putting out this false information, they’re attempting to change our perception of what’s true and not true, leaving people believing that they must artificially manipulate their immune systems as the only way to stay safe from infectious disease.

219

Many respected scientists are now calling for a herd immunity approach to the pandemic, meaning governments should allow people who are not at significant risk of serious COVID-19 illness to go back to normal life.

219

Tens of thousands of medical practitioners and scientists have signed the Great Barrington Declaration, which calls for “focused protection” rather than blanket lockdowns:

We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young. Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza. As immunity builds in the population, the risk of infection to all—including the vulnerable—falls.

We know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity—i.e. the point at which the rate of new infections is stable—and that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine. Our goal should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity.

The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this Focused Protection.72

It’s All Part of the Plan

220

There’s been considerable global resistance to mandatory COVID-19 vaccination, but even if the vaccine ends up being “voluntary,” refusing to take it may end up having severe implications for people who enjoy their freedom.

220

The Commons Project, the World Economic Forum, and the Rockefeller Foundation have joined forces to create the CommonPass, a digital “health passport” framework expected to be adopted by most if not all nations.73 In other words, if you want to travel, you’re going to have to roll up your sleeves and hope you’re not one of the unlucky ones who end up with a permanent health problem from the vaccine.

220

The groundwork for CommonPass was laid out in an April 21, 2020, white paper by the Rockefeller Foundation, and based on this paper, it’s clear that proof of vaccination is part of a permanent surveillance and social control structure—one that severely limits personal liberty and freedom of choice across the board.74

305

74.   Rockefeller Foundation, “National COVID-19 Testing Action Plan—Strategic Steps to Reopen Our Workplaces and Our Communities,” April 21, 2020 (PDF), https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TheRockefellerFoundation_WhitePaper_Covid19_4_22_2020.pdf

220

There’s absolutely no indication that proof of vaccination status will become obsolete once the COVID-19 pandemic is declared over, and the reason for this is because the pandemic is being used as a justification for the Great Reset, which will usher in a new system of technocracy that relies on digital surveillance and social engineering to control the population.

220

Proof of vaccination allows for the rollout of a highly invasive form of tracking that will undoubtedly expand with time. The tracking system proposed by the Rockefeller Foundation demands access to other medical data right from the get-go, which tells us the system will have any number of other uses besides tracking COVID-19 cases.

221

Any company can implement compulsory COVID-19 vaccination. No one is automatically excluded. Anyone could soon have to face the choice of vaccination or unemployment. Most schools are already saying they’ll require students and staff to get inoculated against COVID-19. As reported by National Geographic, depending on where you live and the political philosophy of the majority of representatives in your state legislature, refusing the vaccine may also bar you from:75

Obtaining a driver’s license or passport.

Attending a sports game or concert.

Getting an education.

Boarding a train or other public transportation.

Entering a store, restaurant, bar, coffee shop, or nail salon.

Booking an appointment with a doctor.

Checking into a hospital for surgery.

Visiting a family member in a nursing home.

Obtaining private health insurance and Medicaid or Medicare.

221

There can be little doubt that the CommonPass is a cog in this Great Reset plan. It’s the beginning stage of mass tracking and tracing, under the guise of keeping everyone safe from infectious disease. Rest assured, it will not be limited to COVID-19. The pandemic is just the justification for ushering in radical limitations on personal freedom and a massive increase in surveillance.
