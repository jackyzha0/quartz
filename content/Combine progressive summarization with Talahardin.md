I find [[thoughts/tiago forte]]'s [[Progressive summarization]] long and it doesn't include writing atomic notes that would fit the [[Talahardin]]. But it is product-oriented (i.e., ideally produces in a blog post) and can actually be used as a preliminary process to produce atomic notes. Here are a couple of thoughts on how to do this:

1. Do the zettels first before writing the summary. This also means the zettles are the priority. If we lose motivation, at least we have done the most important part.
2. Lessen the highlighting to just one or two levels.
