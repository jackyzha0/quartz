Among the many editorial tasks of the brain, performed so rapidly and smoothly that we do not notice it, is the classification of the separate quanta of perception into “inside” and “outside.” That this neat system does not accord with the fact that [[The brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input]]. Thus, it can be abolished entirely, with great profit in terms of insight, we learn from the type of metaprogramming experience called [[dhyana]]. Crowley says of the dhyana experience: In the course of our concentration we noticed that the contents of the mind at any moment consisted of two things, and no more: the (external) Object, variable, and the (internal) Subject, invariable, or apparently so. By success in dharana* the object has been made as invariable as the subject. Now the result of this is that the two become one. This phenomenon usually comes as a tremendous shock. Silent meditation on one object for many weeks, like the Zen monk with the ox. In our words, “mind” (whatever that is) and its contents are functionally identical. The usual system of classifying the contents as “me” (part of “mind”) and not-“me” (“outside”) can be abolished—not just by meditation, but by certain well-known drugs—and the unity of the field of perception is then recognized. We become Metaprogrammers. This is what we might expect from the triumphs of field theory and general systems theory in sociology, anthropology, quantum theory etc. It still comes as a distinct shock when it is experienced and not just talked about. When “I” and “my world” (field of perception) become one, “I” am transformed utterly.
