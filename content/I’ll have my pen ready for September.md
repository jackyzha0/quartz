I’m going to take part in Jason Becker’s [Letters Project](https://json.blog/2022/11/28/a-new-project.html) in September. Looking forward to it. 

By that time I’ll have read something like 40 pieces of correspondence between Jason and others so I’ll know a lot about him compared to what he knows about me. I’m curious to find out how that shifts the dynamic of the conversation.
