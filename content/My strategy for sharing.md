There is a tight connection between [[Review]] and [[Sharing]]. Not all artifacts created during a creative session get shared, and perhaps they shouldn’t. Of course, strategies differ from person to person, but there is a big chance that you don't want to overwhelm your audience or yourself by oversharing. Reviews are necessary to determine which among the artifacts created are worth sharing.

In my strategy, a period of reviewing will usually be followed by a period of sharing.

# Daily

Every morning, I perform [[My daily review routine]]. If I find something from my recent process that I think is worth-sharing then I post on social media. If it's an update, I share a short post and a related photo. If it’s a question, I just ask the question. I share via Instagram and Facebook. But I want to explore sharing via Mastodon.

Having said that, I don’t want to pressure myself with sharing daily. If there is nothing good to share, I don’t have to share.

# Weekly

Every Monday, I perform [[thoughts/my weekly review routine]]. I simply review my daily reports and aggregate them to create a weekly report. I won't share this report though as I don't want to be pressured to produce a publishable artifact every week. In addition, I also don't want to be pressured to make progress every week. Progress will be done, but I don't want to be pressured to make it.

# Monthly

Every beginning of the month, I perform [[my monthly review routine]]. Using a template, I review weekly reports and aggregate them into a monthly report. This monthly report gets shared to an email list via TinyLetter. Like the annual report, this is a non-negotiable artifact that has to be shared every month.

# Annually

Every first week of January, I perform [[My annual review routine]]. Using a template, I review monthly reports and aggregate them into an annual report. This annual report gets shared to my email list via TinyLetter. Along with the monthly report, this is a non-negotiable artifact that has to be shared every year.

# As it happens

In line with the philosophy of to [[thoughts/work with the garage door up]], changes in my Talahardin notes or website pages go live whenever they are published. Those who use an RSS feed to follow my website will receive notifications automatically when a page is published or gets updated. However, I am not compelled to share these in other venues. They are meant to be explored by the curious.

That said, [[My note-writing process]] scheduled every morning should allow me to do incremental writing progress related to my individual projects. Each project has to be documented and reported slowly through notes that later on evolve into publishable reports that make up the pages of the website.

# Inspiration

This strategy was inspired by [[Hundred Rabbits]]’ [logs](https://100r.co/site/log.html) and [[Andy Matuschak]]'s [working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).
