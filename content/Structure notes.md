While the strength of [[Talahardin]] lies in its non-heirarchical top-down design, hierarchical structures can still be very useful particularly when getting a bird's eyeview of the relationships among your [[Evergreens]]. This is where structure notes can be helpful.

[[Sascha Fast]] calls structure notes “meta-notes" as they are permanent notes about other permanent notes. They are similar (probably a digital version) of [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s [[Hub notes]].

Think of structure notes like a “Table of Contents” for the best permanent notes on a big topic.

For a guide on creating them, see [[How to create structure notes]].

Structure notes also serve as the end goal artifact of general projects in lieu of a a manuscript or draft common in writing projects.

To do

- Simplify the note by note excessively mentioning other peoles.
- Decide if you are going to integrate this term in to your system.
