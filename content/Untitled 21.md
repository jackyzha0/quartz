I sync through an app one my phone called working copy and a git client called gitkraken on my pc. Both apps observe my vault folders on each device and detect changes. Those changes then can be pushed to my GitHub account and I can refresh my git client on other device to receive those changes. That's all there is to the process really. There's some YouTube videos on it. Heres a bigger one: https://watch.whatever.social/watch?v=H6ipjzaN2WY. He uses the terminal tho which I didn't bother with because I'm not good with it.
