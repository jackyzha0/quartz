## Identity view  #⏳ 

Giving up [[craving]] is so difficult because [[craving]] is reinforced by views, which [[Rationalization|rationalize]] our identification with [[the five aggregates]] and thus equip [[craving]] with a protective shield. The type of view that lies at the bottom of all affirmation of selfhood. [[The Nikayas]] often mention twenty types of identity view, obtained by considering oneself to stand in relation to each of [[the five aggregates]]: either as being identical with it, as possesing it, as containing it, or as being contained within it. Adopting any of these views is a cause of anxiety and distress. 

- it is a cause of clinging and duality
- Duality implies that things have separate and enduring essences
- Much of human suffering stems from having this self that needs to be psychologically defended at all costs. 

It is through [[insight]] into [[the three characteristics]] that ones sees the true nature of [[the five aggregates]] and no longer regards them as self or the belongings of a self.
