## The right hemisphere is responsible for the ability to put ourselves in anothers shoes  # 

Because of the [[right hemisphere]]'s openness to the interconnectedness of things (see [[the right hemisphere sees things in their context]]), it is interested in others as individuals, and in how we relate to them. It is the mediator of empathic identification. I imagine myself in pain I use both hemispheres, but your pain is in my [[right hemisphere]]. The same [[neuron]]s in the right [[anterior cingulate cortex]], an area known to be associated with the appreciation of pain, show activity whether we ourselves are hurt or we witness someone else undergoing a similar painful experience. Self-awareness, empathy, identification with others, and more generally inter-subjective processes, are largely dependent upon [[right hemisphere]] resources. When we put ourselves in others' shoes, we are using the right [[inferior parietal lobe]], and the right [[lateral prefrontal cortex]], which is involved in inhibiting the automatic tendency to espouse one's own point of view. In circumstances of [[right hemisphere]] activation, subjects are more favorably disposed towards others and more readily convinced by arguments in favor of positions that they have not previously supported.
