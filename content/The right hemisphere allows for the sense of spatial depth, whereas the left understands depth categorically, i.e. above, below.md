## The right hemisphere allows for the sense of spatial depth, whereas the left understands depth categorically, i.e. above, below # 

The equivalent of time in the visual realm could be thought of as spatial depth: indeed since [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] we have come to understand that time and space are aspects of one entity—thus space-time. As it is the [[right hemisphere]] that gives ‘depth’ to our sense of time ([[The right hemisphere is responsible for our sense of time as continuous and unified]]), in the visual realm it is the [[right hemisphere]] that gives us the means of appreciating depth in space, the way in which we stand in relation to others, rather than by categorization. The [[right hemisphere]] has a tendency to deal with spatial relations in terms of the degree of distance, which it can discriminate easily, in contrast with the strategy of the [[left hemisphere]], which tends to be more categorical: ‘above’, ‘below’, and so on.

There is a parallel here with the sense of time: duration belongs to the [[right hemisphere]], while sequencing (‘before’, ‘after’ = ‘above’, ‘below’) belongs to the [[left hemisphere]]. The [[right hemisphere]]'s organisation of space depends more on depth, whether things are nearer or further ‘from me’. The [[right hemisphere]] is even biased towards what lies further ‘from me’, an aspect of its broader, wider and deeper attention ([[The right hemisphere has broad, global, and flexible attention, while the left has narrow attention]]). The [[left hemisphere]], by comparison, has difficulty with processing depth: as a result, it may get the size of things wrong, sometimes dramatically.
