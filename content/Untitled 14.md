Are you guys aware of any writings that criticize conventional religions tendency to to moralize behaviors and consider them inherently "good" or "evil" and base there renunciation on repression and guilt rather than relying on experience to determine the worth of actions and become naturally dispassionate (like vipassana)? William Blake is like the only guy I've seen who addresses this somewhat but I'd like some things that are less poetic as well

I honestly think this explains so much of what we see in the world these days
