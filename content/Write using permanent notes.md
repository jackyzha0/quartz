Writing using [[Evergreens]] from a [[Talahardin]] is taking individual insights from their original linear contexts and mixing them up into a new linear context.

The general process is simple:

1. [[Look inside the Talahardin for a topic]] Develop projects from the bottom up. Look at what is already in the Talahardin. Reflect on what is missing. Look for good questions, i.e. in the sweetspot of being relevant and interesting. Use this to guide you about what to read and how to develop your arguments. When notes start to cluster around one topic, consider using that topic for a project.
2. Look for connections. Look for connections between different notes and collect them into one place.
3. Bring the collected notes in order ([[How to outline in Talahardin]]).
4. If necessary, go back to reading and note-taking to improve your ideas and their structure.
5. Turn your notes into a rough draft.
6. Edit and proofread.

A hallmark of works written using a Talahardin that readers notice is that they tend to [[Squeeze as much insight as possible into one publication]]. It is easy to do this because of the abundance of insights captured in notes that accumulate through time.

Aside from making writing easier ([[Writing can be easy]]), [[Writing using permanent notes encourages a scout mindset]].
