## Writers in an anarcho-communist society with work with collaborators instead of publishers to get their work published  # 

In an [[Anarchism|anarcho]]-[[Communism|communist]] society, when someone will have something useful to say—a word that goes beyond the thoughts of their century, they will not have to look for an editor who might provide the necessary [[capital]]. They will look for collaborators who know the printing trade, and who approve of the ideas. Together they will publish the new book or journal.

Literature and journalism will cease to be a means of moneymaking and living at the cost of others. But is there anyone who knows literature and journalism from within, and who does not ardently desire that literature should at last be able to free itself from those who formerly protected it, and who now exploit it, and from the multitude which, with rare exceptions, pays for it in proportion to its mediocrity, or to the ease with which it adapts itself to the bad taste of the masses? Writing and science will only take their proper place in the work of human development when, freed from all mercenary bondage, they will be exclusively cultivated by those who love them, and for those who love them.
