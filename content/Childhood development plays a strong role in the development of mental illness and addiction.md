## Childhood development plays a strong role in the development of mental illness and addiction  # 

[[Brain]] development in the [[uterus]] and during childhood is the single most important biological factor in determining whether or not a person will be predisposed to substance dependence and to [[Addiction|addictive]] behaviors of any sort, whether drug-related or not. Startling as this view may appear to be at first sight, it is amply supported by research. Dr. [[Vincent Felitti]] was chief investigator in a landmark study of over seventeen thousand middle-class Americans for Kaiser Permanente and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. “The basic cause of [[addiction]] is predominantly experience-dependent during childhood, and not substance-dependent,” Dr. Felitti has written. “The current concept of [[addiction]] is ill-founded.”
