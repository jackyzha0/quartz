## In the late 80s and 90s, new SSRIs began to sell widely and rapidly # 

[[During the 70s, psychiatric drugs became much less risky and were beginning to be offered to the wider temporarily distressed public]]. Next came the inexorable march of the [[SSRI]] [[antidepressant]]s in the late 1980s and early 1990s—a classic marketing success story. [[Prozac]] became a knockout best seller, even spawning a best-selling book by a psychiatrist touting its value not only as an antidepressant but also as a cosmetic drug that could make you better than well. Every year or two thereafter, a new [[SSRI]] would appear—Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa—and each would also in turn become a runaway best seller. The marketing of these easy-to-use drugs was closely tied to the marketing of what were (according to the drug companies) easy-to-make psychiatric diagnoses.

Soon the SSRIs were also prescribed for panic disorder, [[generalized anxiety]], social phobia, [[OCD]], [[PTSD]], eating disorders, premature ejaculation, and compulsive gambling, and as a general pick-me-up. Sure, there were side effects—some frequent (like reduced sexuality); some rare but dangerous (like agitation, suicidality, and violence). But [[SSRI]]s fit so neatly into everyday life that 20 percent of women now take them. Diagnostic inflation will always be an inevitable consequence of an aggressively marketed, easy-to-take pill.
