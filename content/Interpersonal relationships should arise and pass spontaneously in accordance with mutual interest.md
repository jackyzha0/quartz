## Interpersonal relationships should arise and pass spontaneously in accordance with mutual interest # 

Title ideas:

- interpersonal relationships should arise without forcing and pass without clinging

___

- you should only talk to people when you genuinely have something to say
- Deliberately seeking out relationships is inherently desperate. You would not feel compelled to do that if you were fine with solitude
- If you did find a relationship by obsessively looking, your only gonna meet people as shallow and desperate as you are
- The most fulfilling relationships are rev ones that you don’t have to put effort into establishing or maintaining. That indicates genuine compatability 
- This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take the initiative to approach someone who interests you
	- as long as your still developing your own identity and don’t give that up and center your identity around that person
- I think companionship is a great thing to have. But it should only add value to an already good life. Nobody should be dependent on it for their happiness. It’s even ok to miss somebody, but not to the point to where your completely devastated and depressed
- This is also the reason why it’s good to approach people and why I no longer agree that approaching people is rooted in attachment and existential issues
- Even if companionship is not necessary for a happy life,
- The difference between me and other people is I see relationships as a nice thing to have whereas others see it as a necessity

___

- it still adds value to life, so I no longer see anything wrong in pursuing relationships when you perceive a good opportunity
- you cannot expect companionship to just come to you without initiating it. It’s like waiting for a job without applying. It _might_ happen but it’s unlikely
- Having purpose in your life makes rejection no longer sting because you don’t invest so much emotionally into acceptance. You have things to look forward to outside of relationships
- interpersonal relationships should not be about validation seeking. If it is, then it’s not a true relationship. They’re only there to selfishly fulfill your need for validation. You are not actually interested in each other. You’re not there for a conversation, but only to talk about yourself. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/ec631z/is_it_normal_to_feel_most_people_just_talk_about/ These people only care about validation

___

Social advice usually involves things like "just improve your social skills and body language,” "just approach strangers more often," etc. This kind of advice is given with the assumption that interpersonal relationships are something to be sought out deliberately. All interactions of this kind would be disingenuous as they are initiated with the intention to be friends before knowing anything about them. The tension and discomfort is not because that person initiating the interaction is “afraid of rejection” as is commonly said, but because such interactions are simply forced! People, believe it or not, do _not_ want to be forced into conversations with complete strangers while they’re busy going about their day.

The irony is that it is solitude itself that is required to develop the personality that would make you socially appealing in the first place. [[Facing loneliness is necessary to develop a stronger sense of identity]]. By engaging in self-discovery, we can have a better idea of what kinds of social groups we would like enjoy being apart of, 

You will inevitable have conversations through inquiry and discussion about i topic you genially care about. [[non-forcing|Non-forced]] relationships will inadvertently arise from such conversation. I like to think of a friendship as an extended conversation. This cannot occur for those without a solid identity. Fulfilling relationships therefor are not something you look for, but is something that happens by chance as we interact with people while pursuing our interests.

People should not adopt hobbies and interests for the sake of making friends. You should do so because you're genuinely in that activity.

And as the initial chemistry fizzles out, such relationships will naturally drift apart without any attachment, because [[as we self-realize we become more sure of our identity and less reliant of the validation of others]]. You were not friends out of requirement, but because they simply improved the quality of an already fulfilling live. If they do _not_ improve the qualilty of your life, then their would be no purpose in continuiting that relationship.

Any relationships that are not rooted in mutual interest and involves any sort of attachment generally serve to quell insecure [[attachment]] because [[a secure attachment in childhood is necessary for the development of the capacity to be alone]]. Or it is to avoid the emptiness felt by those who lack an identity, as [[the emptiness and anxiety that people with a weak identity feel becomes more acute during periods of solitude]]. [[As we self-realize we become more sure of our identity and less reliant of the validation of others]].
