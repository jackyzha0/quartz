## Jump out of the system #🧠 

Jumping out of the system refers to an inherent property of intelligence in which it can jump out of the task which it is performing, and survey what it has done; it is always looking for and often finding patterns.

For example, a person who is reading a book may grow sleepy. Instead of continuing to read the book until they’re finished, they are just as likely to put the book aside and turn off the light. They have stepped "out of the system" and yet it seems the most natural thing in the world to us. Or, suppose person A is watching TV when person B comes in the room and shows evident displeasure with the situation. Person A may think they understand the problem, and try to remedy it by exiting the present system (that TV program), by changing the channel and looking for a better show. Person B may have a more radio concept of what it is to  "exit the system"-namely to turn the TV off. Jumping out of the system is something a conventional machine is incapable of: [[Humans differ from machines in that they are able to make observations about their own behavior]].

Of course, there are cases where only a rare individual will have the vision to perceive a system which governs many peoples lives, a system which has never before even been recognized as a system; then such people often devote their lives to convincing other people that the system really is there and that it ought to be exited from!
