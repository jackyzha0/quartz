![[DE3304DE-ACDE-444A-94AA-C476A12166F1.png|200]]

The ventromedial [[prefrontal cortex]] is a part of the [[prefrontal cortex]] and is implicated in the processing of risk and fear, as it is critical in the regulation of [[amygdala]] activity. It also plays a role in the inhibition of emotional responses, and in the process of decision making and self control. It is also involved in the cognitive evaluation of morality.

Patients with lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex are impulsive, fail to foresee consequences and are emotionally disengaged from others; in particular the right ventromedial frontal cortex, which has rich interconnections with [[limbic system]], is critical to every aspect of moral and social behavior. Moral judgment involves a complex [[right hemisphere]] network, particularly the right ventromedial and [[orbitofrontal cortex]], as well as the [[amygdala]] in both hemispheres. Damage in the right [[prefrontal cortex]] may lead to frank [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] behavior.
