## Prefer positive notes titles to promote linking  #⏳ 

When writing notes, its tempting to write "X is bad" or "X doesnt work". These negativley oriented notes usually contain a descriptive theory of why the missing/flawed property is important. By bringing that theory to the foreground, you make it easier to see the claims in a systematic sense, which, in turn makes it easier to build upon.
