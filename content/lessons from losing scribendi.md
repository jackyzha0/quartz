- Working back to a 9-5 job isn't easy.
- Scribendi was indeed a rare job: decent amount of money in relatively quick time. It gave me the illusion of financial freedom. But it was a pseudo financial freedom.
- I can exist in both a gift economy and an exchange economy. And I recognize that what I want to do lies more in the gift economy. However, the dominant economy now is the exchange economy. I exist there more, and, therefore, I need to respect its rules. I need to build career capital. I couldn't cheat my way to the things I want in the exchange economy.
- I must learn to heed early warnings and not learn my lessons the hard way.
- It is clear to me now that I need to be more entrepreneurial. I cannot, again, rely on just one source of income.
