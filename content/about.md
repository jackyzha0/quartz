Welcome to The Quantum Garden, a site where I share what interests me in the hope you'll find it interesting as well.

Time spent in the garden is all about cultivating possibilities in life. Often the possibility is already there and waiting to be seen.

My name is David Buchan and if you need to contact me, send a message to @dcbuchan@aus.social. Or you can leave a comment at the bottom of this, or any other post. I'd love to hear from you.

Currently working as an IT Strategy Consultant with an interest in how we use technology to hold meaningful and productive conversation.

My downtime is frequently spent on the Playstation with action adventure games such as [[Horizon Forbidden West]], [[Forspoken]], [[Uncharted]] and [[The Last of Us]]. I also paint Warhammer miniatures when I can be bothered setting up a place to paint. Same with my binoculars for astronomy. I would play D&D if I could commit the time.

My reading is mostly science fiction/fantasy.

I enjoy non-processional car racing which means a thumbs up for GT3, Indycar and of course the Bathurst 1000. My go-to racing sim games are Assetto Corsa Competizione and Gran Turismo 7 with a wheel.

I don't much enjoy long walks on the beach.
