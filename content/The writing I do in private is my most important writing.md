Writing is not the end goal in [[My life plan]]. Writing is simply a tool I use to facilitate the enhancement of the most important of the [[Five areas of my life work]]: [[thoughts/living]]. I write to uncover what is true, to understand how truth relates to how I want to act,  and to create meaning from my actions and experiences ([[Writing is the best facilitator for thinking]]). Writing helps me live more effectively and intentionally.

Therefore, the most important writing I do is journaling, note-writing in my [[Talahardin]], and other writings I do in private. These kinds of writing are not performative. They are deeply personal and functional.

An excemption is perhaps [[Uman]], which, although public, serves a very important purpose: to help me [[Review]] my actions and, therefore, check whether my end results match my intentions ([[An action succeeded if its end state approximates its intention]]).

This also shows that my strengths as a writer is not in skilfull narrative or even poetry but still in philosophy ([[Thoreau prioritized content over style in his writing]]). Writing helps me think better and make philosophy a personal project.
