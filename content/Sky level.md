Since you have to [[Build a life management system that helps you take intentional action]], your [[thoughts/life management system]] must have a component that encourages the discovery and awareness of your intentions and motivations. This is what the sky level accomplishes.

The sky level could be articulated through a single document or digital note. Mine is called [[My LMS sky level setup]]. The note should link to the following individual notes:

- [[Purpose statement]]
- [[Vision statement]]
- [[thoughts/life area]]s
- [[Goal]]s
- [[Routines]]

These five are the basic components. As additional resources, you can also compile the following:

- A list of activities you can do to improve introspection and getting in touch with what you want
- A plan on how to execute these activities
- A list of your [[core desired mental state]]s
- A list of your top [[Value]]s
- A list of your top five character strengths
