## Samsara #⏳ 

In Buddhism, Samsara is the continuous cycle of repeated [[rebirth]], mundane existence, and death without a disernable beginning or end. It is described as a pointless wandering from one life to the next with no paticular direction. This  wandering is perpetauted by [[the taints]].
