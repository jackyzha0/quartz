## Neuroscience Constellation

Neuroscience is the scientific study of the [[nervous system]] and its functions.

### Neuroscience Notes

- [[Neuron]]
- [[Left hemisphere]]
- [[Right hemisphere]]
- [[The left hemisphere handles focussed attention]]
- [[The right hemisphere handles alertness, vigilance, sustained attention, and divided attention]]
- [[Thinking is the evolutionary internalization of physical movement]]
- [[Exercise has been shown to raise levels of BDNF]]
- [[BDNF is necessary for LTP to be able to occur]]
- [[It has been shown that new neurons are able to be created in the brain]]
- [[A newborn neuron must find something to do to survive]]
- [[Exercise has been shown to increase neurogenisis]]
- [[Mice who exercise are shown to learn faster than sedantary ones]]
- [[Exercise triggers the release of hormones that promote the growth of new brain cells]]
- [[IGF-1]]
- [[VEGF]]
- [[FGF-2]]
- [[BDNF works with IGF-1 promote the growth of neurons]]
- [[High intensity workouts are bad for learning]]
- [[Cognitive flexibility has been shown to improve after a medium intensity run]]
- [[Aerobic exercises requiring coordination are better for learning]]
- [[Neurogenesis]]
- [[Environmental enrichment]]
- [[ADHD and addiction can be traced to similar causes]]
- [[Gluconeogenesis removes the brains need for carbohydrate consumption]]
- [[The bad gut bacteria produced from a poor diet can induce depression symptoms]]
- [[Meditators have been shown to be able to uncouple negative emotional reactions from their behavior]]
- [[Depression can interfere with circadian cortisol regulation]]
- [[Processing ambiguity requires right hemisphere intuition because language is to precise and definite]]
- [[Addictive substances were generally hard to come by in the past]]
- [[Humans have evolved a taste for sugar because food was usually never both sweet and poisonous]]
- [[A gluten-free diet can increase amino acids known to be precursors for mood regulating neurotransmitters for those with gluten issues]]
- [[A lack of predictability as to when a stressor will occur has been shown to increase chronic stress]]
- [[Organisms will habituate to stressors that are experienced predictably]]
- [[Receiving a reward at an unpredictable time interval creates a stronger stress response than when it is received predictably]]
- [[Unpredictability can cause a higher stress response than if conditions were more stressful overall but still consistent]]
- [[People with depression generally have higher levels of glucocorticoids due to an overactive stress-response]]
- [[The frontal cortex is equally vulnerable to shrinkage from cortisol as the hippocampus]]
- [[Genes that predispose someone to depression are only expressed when they are repeatedly exposed to stressors]]
- [[Hierarchically subordinate animals have higher resting levels of glucocorticoids and an ineffecient stress-response]]
- [[The frequency of harrasment by superiors and the lack of opportunities for social support have been shown to be the best predictors of elevated glucocorticoid levels among low ranking members of hierarchical groups]]
- [[A low hierarchical rank can have different implications within different species or animal cultures]]
- [[The stability of a hierarchy has a major influence on the stress levels in a group]]
- [[The poor have been shown to have higher levels of cortisol]]
- [[The idea that consciousness emerges from matter is a product of consciousness itself]]
- [[Habits develop to help the brain conserve energy]]
- [[The first stage of perception]]
- [[The second stage of perception]]
- [[The third stage of perception]]
- [[The fourth stage of perception]]
- [[The fifth stage of perception]]
- [[Science used to see attention as involuntary and hardwired]]
