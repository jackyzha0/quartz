## The nine charnel ground contemplations  #⏳ 

The nine charnel ground contemplations are exercises of the [[contemplation of body]]. The exercises involve the contemplation of corpses in different stages of decomposition. [[The Buddha]] explains the exercise as follows:

> “Again, monks, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, one, two, or three days dead, bloated, livid, and oozing matter, a monk compares this same body with it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature, it will be like that, it is not exempt from that fate.''"
> 
> “Again, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals, or various kinds of worms, a monk compares this same body with it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature, it will be like that, it is not exempt from that fate.’"
> 
> “Again, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together with sinews…a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, held together with sinews … a skeleton without flesh and blood, held together with sinews … [or] disconnected bones scattered in all directions ...  a monk compares this same body with it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature, it will be like that, it is not exempt from that fate.’"
> 
> “Again, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, bones bleached white, the color of shells … bones heaped up … bones more than a year old, rotted and crumbled to dust, a monk compares this same body with it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature, it will be like that, it is not exempt from that fate.’"
