## Slightly eccentric and non-conventional people qualified for Aspergers diagnosis # 

The diagnosis of autism has exploded in the past twenty years. Before DSM-IV, this was an extremely rare condition, diagnosed in one child per two thousand. The rate has now jumped to one in eighty in the United States and an even more amazing one in thirty-eight in Korea.14,15,16 The first reaction was parental panic—worries about autism at the slightest sign that a child was not perfectly conventional.

All this reflects the general public misunderstanding of how psychiatric diagnosis works—i.e., that the prevalence rates are always extremely sensitive to any change in definition. The twentyfold increase in just twenty years occurred because diagnostic habits had changed radically, not because kids were suddenly becoming more autistic.

Asperger’s describes people who are strange in some ways (with stereotyped interests, unusual behaviors, and interpersonal problems) but not nearly so gravely impaired as those who have classic autism (which also includes an inability to communicate and lowered IQ). Because many normal people are eccentric and socially awkward, there is no clear line of demarcation separating them from Asperger’s. We had estimated that Asperger’s would be about three times more common than the classic, severe form of autism. But rates have artificially swelled because many people within the range of normal variability (or with other mental disorders) have been misidentified as autistic—especially when the diagnosis is made in primary care, in school systems, and by parents and patients.
