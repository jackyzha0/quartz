## Neuron receptors are still able to regnerate themsleves overtime if the cell is still alive # 

If you stop the overstimulation of the [[nucleus accumbens]] before your [[neuron]]s go through [[apoptosis]] ([[The overstimulation of dopamine receptors may lead to cell damage or death in the nucleus accumbens]]), you still have a fighting chance of pulling out. If the postsynaptic [[neuron]]s are only damaged but still alive, your [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s can regenerate over time. You can restore your [[mesolimbic pathway]] and start over, although [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s aren’t back to normal for 12 to 14 months of complete abstination.
