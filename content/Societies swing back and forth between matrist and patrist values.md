## Societies swing back and forth between matrist and patrist values  # 

has been proposed, by sociologist G. Rattray Taylor that societies swing back and forth between “[[Matrist]]” periods, in which motherly oral values predominate and “[[Patrist]]” periods, in which fatherly anal values are in ascendance. Taylor’s table of the characteristics of these “Matrist” and “Patrist” periods is as follows:

Whether or not societies wobble between these extremes as Taylor claims, individuals certainly do. These are merely the consequences of (a) having the heaviest [[imprint]] on the oral (Matrist) [[limbic system]] or (b) having the heaviest [[imprint]] on the anal (Patrist) [[Emotional-Territorial Circuit]].
