## The right hemisphere allows for the recogition of broad and complex patterns # 

The broader field of attention of the [[right hemisphere]], open to whatever may be, coupled with how [[the right hemisphere is able to access and hold larger quantities of information]], is what makes possible the recognition of broad or complex patterns, the perception of the ‘thing as a whole’, seeing the forest for the trees. The [[left hemisphere]] takes a local short-term view, whereas the [[right hemisphere]] sees the bigger picture.
