I am currently living in Los Baños, Laguna, a town 63 kms away from Manila. It is one of the many places in the Philippines that are fortunate enough to be situated in the middle of a mountain and a large body of water. The house I am living at is literally at the foot of Mt. Makiling, while Laguna Lake is just about a 30 minutes walk away.

Los Baños means "The Baths." The baths refer to the hot springs where Filipinos have built health spas.

This is a good research project. How did the spas started? Are the current baths inherited from the baths in the past?
