## Mendelian inheritance  # 

[[Gregor Mendel]], an Austrian monk, had shown through experiments with 30,000 pea plants that inherited physical characteristics were regularly controlled by a pair of elements (or [[gene]]s), with both the “male” and “female” parent (or part of the plant) contributing a [[gene]]. In plants, such physical characteristics might include size, color, and texture. In many instances, one [[gene]] type was dominant over the other. A “tall” [[gene]] for the height of a plant might be dominant over a “short” [[gene]], and thus a combination of tall-and-short [[gene]]s for height would produce a tall plant, although that plant could now pass on a short [[gene]] to its offspring. If another tall plant did the same, a short plant would result.
