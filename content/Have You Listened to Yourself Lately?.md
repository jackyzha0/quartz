Most of the major questions you will ever ask in your life will be questions about how to live.

Every question about how to live is a question about how to act.

Every question about how to act is a subjective question. The actor is always you, not someone else.

All subjective questions require subjective answers.

Therefore, most of the answers you will need in your life will come within your subjective experience. Not from the subjective experiences of others. To rely solely on the subjective experiences of others for answers on how to live your life is the most violent thing you can ever do to yourself.

Therefore, though it isn't _the_ only way to live, the wisest way to live is to cultivate listening to the answers that come within you—through reason and all the other stuff within you that go beyond reason.

Question is: _Have you listened to yourself lately?_
