## Leap of Faith  #⏳

In the 19th century, philospher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] circled back to the pre [[Thomas Aquinas]] era of Christianity and suggested that the way out of the perpetual relapse into uncertainty is a "leap of faith". His arguement was that all methods of seeking certitude have a concealed "leap of faith" in them, which their devotees conveniently "forget" or overlook. So Kierkegaard asks: why not admit that we are taking a "leap of faith?" The authour [[Robert Anton Wilson]] proposes that there is a more reasonable alternative; namely to avoid the leap of faith and adopt a [[model agnosticism]], although willing to learn from them in an open-minded way.
