## The right hemisphere allows for exploratory attention, while the left only focuses on what’s already been prioritized # 

Essentially the [[left hemisphere]]'s narrow attention ([[The right hemisphere has broad, global, and flexible attention, while the left has narrow attention]]), which it believes it directs towards whatever it may be, has in reality already been seized by the right. It is thus the [[right hemisphere]] that has dominance for exploratory attentional movements, while the [[left hemisphere]] assists in focussed grasping of what has already been prioritized. It is the right hemisphere that controls where that attention is to be oriented.
