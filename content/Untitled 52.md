## Heading # 

This is how we come to know things and how activities like riding a bike become second nature. Patterns of thinking and movement that are automatic get stored in the [[basal ganglia]], [[cerebellum]], and [[brain stem]]. Delegating fundamental knowledge and skills to these subconscious areas frees up the rest of the [[brain]] to continue adapting, and so we would not have to stop and think to process every thought and to remember how to perform every action.
