## The Right Man  #⏳ 

The Right Man is a term coined by the writer [[Alfred Elton van Vogt]] who was inspired to investigate this personality type when writing a novel about concentration camps. While investigating war criminals, he decided to investigate other types of criminals and noticed a pattern. The violent individual seemed to be a person who could literally not, ever, admit that they were wrong. They _know_ they are right, and they must "punish" others for their wrongness. They are the psychological opposite of the [[Model Agnosticism|model agnostic]], claiming total certitude about all things. Van Vogt found that an astonishing amount of violence is committed by such people because this individual always insists that they are right. 

The Right Man tends to seek positions of power. They despise the "softness" of "emotions" and thinks most people are fools. They are obsessed with facts and figures and are rather cold towards human beings. They also have an inclination toward being unwilling to experiement with certain "foreign" or "exotic" foods, and regard philosphical speculation with extreme hostility. The Right Man has a paranoid attitude toward people: he thinks they are all rotten; they have all cheated him; they are always cheating; they are sneaks; they are liars; they are, in fact, rotten bastards. He is going to be the rottenest bastard of all to get back at them. This model describes not only many, many infamous criminals, but quite a few of the more infamous statesmen and churchmen of history, who were not called criminals only because they were powerful enough to define what was "crime" in their society.
