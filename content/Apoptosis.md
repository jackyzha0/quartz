## Apoptosis  #🧠 

Apoptosis is a form of programmed [[cell]] death that occurs in multicellular organisms. Apoptosis is inherent to all cells in the body; it’s the self-destruct program that keeps good cells from turning bad (e.g., cancer). Apoptosis is a normal and very important process throughout the body that clears away overworked, mutated, or just plain old and decrepit cells.
