## The narrowness of certainty appeals to the left hemisphere # 

[[The right hemisphere can understand unclear and fleeting images, while the left requires clarity and stillness]]. Also, [[The right hemisphere has broad, global, and flexible attention, while the left has narrow attention]]. Certainty is also related to narrowness, as though the more certain we become of something the less we see. To put this in the context of the neurophysiology of vision: the [[fovea]] of the human [[eye]], a tiny region in the [[retina]] at the center of gaze, is the most pronounced of that of all primates. Here resolution is about 100 times that at the periphery. But it is only about 1° across. The part of the visual field that is actually brought into resolution is no more than about 3° across. This is where the narrow focused beam of [[left hemisphere]] attention is concentrated: what is clearly seen.
