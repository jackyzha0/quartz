## Spotlight consciousness #🧠 

Spotlight consciousness gives people the ability to narrowly focus attention on a goal. Spotlight consciousness involves the [[left hemisphere]] since it has a narrow attentional window ([[The right hemisphere has broad, global, and flexible attention, while the left has narrow attention]]). Also [[the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]]. [[Our left hemisphere unconsciously focuses on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]]. The [[left hemisphere]] directs the spotlight of its attention where it will and then relies on [[predictive coding]] to interpret what it perceives. This is the default conscious state of adults, as children experience more of [[lantern consciousness]].
