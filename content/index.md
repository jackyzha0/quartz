A long time ago in a year known to many by 2003, I played my first "real" video game: **Pokémon Sapphire**. After encountering it in a Walmart in the great state of Maine, I quickly became enamored with the vaguely whale-shaped creature on the box art for the game. And so I began my scheming to acquire the game for myself.

In about ~0.03 seconds I had formulated my plan. It was simple. Brilliant even. All I need do was ask my grandmother who was with me at that fated Walmart for it. The trick? My parents weren't with us to say no.

And so began my love of video games in earnest. I played many Gameboy Advance games over the next couple of years, eventually migrating to PC and console gaming but always had a soft spot for games with pixel art and turn-based strategy like **Pokémon**, early **Fire Emblem** and of course **Final Fantasy**.

Fast-forward a couple decades and now I am a full-time software engineer with a degree and background that while not all that uncommon these days, puts me in the perfect position to be able to learn how to develop those very same turn-based games I loved growing up.

So come join me in here in this blog where I will be attempting to document my progress as an amateur game developer as I work on my new open-world tactics RPG game **The Far Reaches**. I will be splitting these into two major categories:
- **Graphics Blog** A series of posts designed to introduce the high-level concepts and problems I encounter during development as well as my designs and solutions for solving them. I will attempt to explain these in layman's terms but a cursory understanding of some topics may be required.
- **Dev Log** A series of more casual posts that detail the progress and design decisions I have made for my game. These will likely be more of a "stream of consciousness"-type post that go over more game-specific stuff.
