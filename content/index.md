title: Welcome to Quartz 4
---

Quartz is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites. Thousands of students, developers, and teachers are [[showcase|already using Quartz]] to publish personal notes, wikis, and [digital gardens](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/) to the web.

## 🪴 Get Started
Quartz requires **at least [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v16** to function correctly. In your terminal of choice, enter the following commands line by line:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
cd quartz
git checkout v4-alpha
npm i
npx quartz create
```

This will guide you through initializing your Quartz with content and previewing it locally.

When you're ready, you can edit `quartz.config.ts` to customize and configure Quartz more. Read the [[configuration]] page for more information on what each field in the configuration does.
