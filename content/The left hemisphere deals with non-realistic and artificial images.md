## The left hemisphere deals with non-realistic and artificial images  # 

Contrary to how [[the right hemisphere deals with real things that have meaning to us in the lived world]], the [[left hemisphere]] is more at home dealing with distorted, non-realistic, fantastic—ultimately artificial—images. This may be because they invite analysis by parts, rather than as a whole (see [[The right hemisphere sees the whole first, and then the left hemisphere separates it into parts]]). But it does appear that the [[left hemisphere]] has a positive bias towards whatever is bizarre, meaningless or non-existent.
