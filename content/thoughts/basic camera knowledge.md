Be in Aperture Priority mode.

Set ISO first.
- 400 on overcast day
- If darker, increase.

Set aperture depending on the need.
- small f-number = small area of focus; big f-number = big area of focus.

Let the camera adjust shutter speed.
- Dark = slow shutter speed
- Bright = fast shutter speed
- Slow shutter speed = blur
- To freeze movement, choose 1/125 or faster
