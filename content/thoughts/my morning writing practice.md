If I don't have to work on a project during the writing block of the uninterrupted morning block of [[My daily routine]], I jump right into the core of my creative practice: writing inside [[thoughts/forest garden of the mind]].

I do my writing in the morning to take the most advantage of the clarity and focus and usually have after a good sleep.

There are several types of [[Seeds]] and [[Seedlings]] in my forest garden, but I prioritize developing [[templates/essay]] and [[thoughts/poems]]. I scout my [[writing inbox]] for any unfinished essay or poem and work on them.

If I am running out of essays or poems to work on, this means my writing prompts are running out and I need to generate more prompts through the following:
1. I review and process at least two previous [[Diary]] entries and see if I could generate new prompts from them.
2. I review and process [[Seeds]] (snippets taken during a walk). I begin with yesterday then move my way backwards.
3. I review insight notes.
4. I review literature notes.

Throughout this process, my main goal is to move seeds and seedlings to [[Evergreens]]. Evergreen poems and essays are important so I have something to share in a regular basis. But evergreen thought notes are also important because they determine evergreen essay production and, more importantly, inform my project for [[thoughts/intentional living]]. I strive to process at least one note every day.

By the end of my session, I push changes in my forest garden to its public version powered by [[thoughts/quartz]] and Github.

After this, I read. I attempt to read at least one page from a book or an article each day. If the material is theoretical, I make highlights, which I process into literature notes later ([[how to write literature notes]]).

Lastly, I process any photos I may have taken the previous day. Processing involves deleting bad shots.
