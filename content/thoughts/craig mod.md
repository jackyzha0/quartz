Craig Mod is a writer and photographer from Japan. He blogs at craigmod.com. He’s like a modern-day [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]] who walks and writes, except he’s not too particular with philosophy and is more interested in culture, literature, and story-telling. That is why he talked to other people, unlike Thoreau or [[Annie Dillard]] who engaged more with [[Nature]] and, thus, talked more to themselves. (Note: How much should I talk to people I meet on my walks?)

What I think I can steal from his process is how he organizes long-walks and create publishable artifacts from those walks.

2019 walk that turned to kissa by kissa was what started his walk as a platform model
