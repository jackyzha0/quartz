Somehow, I see writing in my journal as something sacred, reverent, and venerable. And perhaps it is. For many years it has helped me go through a lot of things. It has brought me to many places. The words that started here has become notes on my garden, which in turn become posts on my blog and newsletter.

So yes, I will continue to treat writing on my journal as one of those sacred things that needs to be respected, observed, and most importantly enjoyed.

The little time I spend here everyday, esp. when I only cover a page is a period of silence, presence, and introspection, and I should do my best to make it that way for as many days as I could.
