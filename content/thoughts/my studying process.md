The [[Talahardin]] cycle refers to the holistic process of using the system in engaging with information and generating knowledge. It is a cycle because the end of one loop informs the next. The phases of this cycle are:

1. [[Metalearning]]
2. [[thoughts/reading]], highlighting, and taking [[literature notes]]
3. Reading highlights and writing [[Evergreens]]
4. Developing [[Structure notes]], [[Outline notes]], or drafts
5. Reflecting ([[My daily review routine]])

The cycle can be done in two ways:
1. [[Talahardin cycle when reading one book]]
2. [[Talahardin cycle as one study session]]
