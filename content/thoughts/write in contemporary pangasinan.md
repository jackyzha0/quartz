I commit to writing in contemporary [[thoughts/pangasinan|Pangasinan]], a Pangasinan, which although occasionally will raise unfamiliar words, doesn't require the reader to look or the meaning of these words every time. The works of most living Pangasinan writers seem to be written in this archaic Pangasinan. It seems that the more unusual the words, the more literary it is. And the problem with this is that a dictionary isn't always available. This is where I diverge. I shall dedicate myself to writing what I want to write (existential writing) in a Pangasinan that I hear spoken in every day, in a Pangasinan that I am familiar with, and that I hope more Pangasinenses will understand and appreciate.

I am no longer a JW, but an important inheritance I got from my time as one is the use of Pangasinan that is a balance of elegance and every day. It isn't poetic, but it is instructive. Majority understandable but once in a while a difficult word arises.
