![Lurem](Lurem.jpg)

_Lurem_ is barely breathing. Her breathing is segmented. One quick out-breath, then a long pause, then another quick out-breath. It is as if she isn’t breathing anything in. She’s just releasing whatever darkness is inside her.

I lay down next to her under the stars. _Laki Dika_ said it will help her. “The light from the forefathers will restore her spirit,” he said. And so I brought her here in the middle of the wide _Laoac na Ansisit_. I carried her here with my own bare shoulders even if she was twice my size, a large young _lobo_ who was once filled with endless vigor.

Now, she barely responds to anything. She only wags her tail whenever I call her name. “_Lurem_, _Lurem_, my love. Get better soon. There are lots of _usa_ to hunt!” She wags her tail upon hearing her name and for a moment I feel her spirit jump. But then she goes back to that deep dark abyss that I can’t seem to fathom.

I feel like she knows she’s done and she won’t be able to hunt _usa_ again.

The enemy that did this to her was invisible. Even my father, an albularyo na lobo, can’t identify the evil spirit or whatnot that caused her this sickness. “Just bring her to the waters. Let her drink. She needs to drink a lot. It might save her. There’s nothing more we can do if we don’t know who we’re fighting with,” my father said.

We don’t know who the enemy is. But we do know that something like this was inevitable to happen. _Lurem_ was an entirely different creature, so different from all the other lobos of _Caboloan_. She jumps higher and runs faster than everyone else. When she was born, she immediately stood up on her toes and walked as if she was already walking inside her mother’s womb. She was strong and always happy. But most fascinating of all, she was so curious—excessively curious.

She would leave the _baley_ sometimes, without me, even for days. At first I was worried that she won’t come back. But she always does. And every time she returns, she would appear with an unusual object, dead animal, or fruit between her large sharp teeth. “She has gone into the _Kabilungetan_,” my mother would say in her distressed voice. “That _lobo_ is so hard-headed!”

The _Kabilungetan_ is a forbidden place, a place visible from the highest peak of _Palandey Pugaro_. You can see it on the horizon, surrounded by charcoal black soil, dead trees, and rotten prey under heavy, dark clouds that don’t stop looming above it. Many stories about this place haunted my dreams when I was a boy. Everyone was afraid to venture into this frightful of places. But not _Lurem_. _Lurem_ was different from everyone, both _lobo_ and _tao_.

Even _Kabilungetan_ was her playground.

I do not know if there’s anything we could have done to contain such curiosity, such energy, such wildness, such true nature, such life. If it was fate that brought us a _lobo_ who was this spirited to find her demise too soon, what could we have done to oppose fate? No spell could contain _Lurem’s_ energy. She was a free spirit and she followed the fire within her wherever it brought her, no matter the consequences.

As I lay down right next to her, there under the star-filled sky of the forefathers, I continued listening to the segmented breathing of my young friend. I rested on the calm, serene wave of her spirit, which I have often longed for. I never thought that I would pay a high price to have _Lurem_ be as quiet and calm as a lonely feather.

I touched her fur for the last time. Then I raised my hand and placed it over my heart. I resolved that I will not blame myself for not doing enough to prevent what happened to _Lurem_. I closed my eyes instead and breathed myself, slowly, segmented, so that I may fall asleep, hoping that there, in my sleep, I might see clearly the truth that freedom for each and every creature—_tao_, lobo, _ayep_, _tanaman_—is worth everything, is worth every single pint of life.
