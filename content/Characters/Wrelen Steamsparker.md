## Play
- Long rest to recover spell slots
- Gain advantage on attack/abilility/saving roll once, recover after long rest (Tides of Chaos)
## Spells
- Cantrips
	- Chill Touch
- Level 1
## Wild Magic Surge
- Once per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20 immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher.
- If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.
	- If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic.
	- If it normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.
