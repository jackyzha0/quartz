Style
- She uses lots of metaphor.
- She provides geographical context (p. 4).
- She drops anecdotes and symbolic stories without explaining them (p. 5).
- Intermingles everything. Her writing is also curious and stimulated as if, really, walking.
- She inserts vignettes and settles on them for a while (p. 6).
- She describes general patterns, which means she have observed the same location, the same phenomena many times. But then describes what is happening now, today, as a point of reference or return (p. 7).
- She includes flashbacks or memories (p. 7), which suggests she really is recording stuff.
- She describes something before naming it, creating suspense and mystery (e.g., the giant water bug, p. 8).
- In some areas she starts to sermon. This is her channeling Thoreau (p. 9).
- She tries to write her philosphical thoughts but uses poetic language and metaphors (p. 11).
- She is excellent in describing the landscape (p. 11).
- She also describes a lengthier phenomena like sunset (p. 11).
- She uses short simple sentences.
- She uses disgression.
- She inserts real scientific descriptions.
- She inserts real anthropological accounts. Collect everything interesting!
- In some areas she becomes the subject of her paragraphs and heavily uses "I".
- She uses childhood stories (p. 16).
- She states an axiom. Then suddenly tells a story (p. 20)
- Chapter three is a narrative on an afternoon of walking up until coming home. But within the narratvie are science trivias and writing, that extends the narrative.
.
Learnings
- Collect lots of observations. Stay longer outdoors. Give more time for fieldwork.

Metaphors
- She used the tomcat as a metaphor of her curiosity.
- Mountains are her home; Creeks are the world where stimulus come from.
- When describing how the wind creates ripples on the surface of the water: "it crumples the water's skin." I saw the word crumple used by Craig Mod to describe mountain.
