## A right hemisphere stroke is more disabling than a left in that one loses the ability to socialize and empathize # 

Things that are value-laden for me, because of their place in ‘my’ world, are salient to the [[right hemisphere]], a consequence of its concern for what has personal meaning ([[The right hemisphere deals with real things that have meaning to us in the lived world]]). The ‘I’, here, is a social being, however, not an objectified isolated entity, since the [[right hemisphere]] mediates social behavior in all its ramifications. This is why a [[right hemisphere]] stroke, although not involving speech directly, is in practice more disabling than a [[left hemisphere]] stroke, despite the fact that in a [[left hemisphere]] stroke speech is usually lost. 

Following a [[left hemisphere]] stroke, despite the difficulties incurred with loss of speech and loss of use of the right hand, the chances of independent living are higher than after a [[right hemisphere]] stroke. It is not just the capacity to interpret emotional signals, in a functional or utilitarian sense, that is mediated by the [[right hemisphere]] ([[The right hemisphere is responsible for our capacity for emotional understanding]]). While the capacity to interpret other's minds, even to appreciate what they must be thinking and feeling—the capacity that is missing in [[autism]]—is lost in a [[right hemisphere]] stroke, it is more than that too: it is the capacity positively to empathize. Meaning is more than words.
