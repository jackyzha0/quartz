### Annotations

Po? I mentioned it in the sub-title to this chapter; some of you have been wondering when I will get around to discussing it. Po is not another abominable bit of jargon I have invented like sombunall. Po is an abominable bit of jargon, if you will, that was invented by the psychologist Edward de Bono. It is intended to denote a kind of thinking that goes beyond the Aristotelian true/ false game we played in chapter one, into the alternatives implied in our multiple-choice game in chapter two. Po is simpler and more radical than our multiple-choice game: it takes us into the mode Dr. Finkelstein was suggesting when he said the universe contains a "maybe."

- Highlight(pink) - Page 143 · Location 2920
Be that as it may, Po has some of the functions of von Neumann's "maybe" in taking us beyond Aristotelian true/ false or either/ or games. Po also has some amusing and entertaining functions of its own. For instance, where linear Aristotelian logic works with familiar associations or generalizations (called "laws of thought," of course, by those who have made Aristotle their Idol), Po thinking moves laterally with unfamiliar associations.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 143 · Location 2924
Dr. de Bono claims that Po thinking unleashes creativity and measurably improves students' ability to solve unfamiliar problems.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 143 · Location 2926
In the case of the bear riddle at the beginning of this chapter, a strict and unimaginative Aristotelian would start from geometry and move in linear fashion along familiar mathematical associations. Unless interrupted by a burst of "intuition" this would proceed indefinitely into an infinite regress of more-or-less geometrical thinking.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 143 · Location 2929
In the Po mode, recognizing that the problem is intended to be tricky, one proceeds laterally into the unfamiliar and the deliberately bizarre, almost in the manner of Freudian free-association. Any concept can be attached to "geometry" just by placing the symbol Po in between.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 143 · Location 2931
Thus, one might consider geometry Po Charlie Chaplin, geometry Po sexual desire, geometry Po Chinese painting, etc. If one looks back at the problem for clues, one tries, say, geometry Po color. It is not long before one comes to geometry Po evolution, and the solution begins to dawn,

- Highlight(pink) - Page 143 · Location 2936
De Bono asserts that this process underlies creative breakthroughs in the sciences. He may be right. It seems that, somewhere along the path that led to Special Relativity, Einstein must have been thinking something like photons Po humans. In Aristotelian logic, this is a very, very unlikely connection. Photons, in Aristotelian logic, lead to physics and thus to mathematics and cosmology etc., while humans leads to psychology and thus to sociology and evolution etc.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 144 · Location 2950
Part of the creation of psychoanalysis probably included Freud pondering sexuality Po forgetting or sexuality Po dreaming or something equally "unconnected"—before he connected them.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 144 · Location 2952
Of course, some Po thinking may lead to poetry or great surrealist paintings, instead of science. There is no guarantee as to where Po will land you, which is part of the justification for thinking it relates to that mystery we call "creativity."

- Highlight(pink) - Page 145 · Location 2973
Obviously, if the Po process is part of creativity, and if the Po process also arouses anxiety in the blocked or repressed mind, then we can see easily why so many creative people have been so viciously persecuted in their life-times. We perhaps begin to understand Fundamentalisms of all sorts.

In terms of mathematical information theory, each great painting is important because it contains information. In this theory, information is, roughly, that which you haven't encountered before.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 147 · Location 3005
A painting you have encountered often contains new information again if you suddenly see it in a new way.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 147 · Location 3006
Norbert Wiener, one of the inventors of information theory, expressed this thought by saying great poetry contains more information than political speeches. In a great poem, as in a great painting, you encounter a new and different emic reality, a new way of perceiving/experiencing humanity-in-universe. A political speech, typically, merely regurgitates old reality-tunnels.

Great art, in terms of this metaphor, is merely the opposite of cliché—it takes us to a new window, instead of gazing through a habitual window. That is why the greatest art, notoriously, is always denounced as "bizarre" and "barbarous" when it first appears. The best books are called "unreadable" because people at first do not know how to read them.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 147 · Location 3012
The perspective of anthropology and of ethnomethodology, and of this book, is like the perspective of a cosmopolitan art critic. It asks us to try many reality-windows instead of standing hypnotized at our habitual window all our lives.

But: If the space-time event in the optical diagram is what we call "grass," is the green "in" the synergetic eye-brain system, or "in" the higher-order holism of eye-brain-grass?

- Highlight(pink) - Page 156 · Location 3204
One Zen student, who pondered long on "The Master who makes the grass green" ran to his roshi (teacher) in excitement and announced, "I've got it! I've got it! That rock over there is inside my head." "You must have a big head," the roshi said, "to hold a rock that size."

The principle illustrated by Roosevelt's experiment—if this widely-published anecdote really happened—will surprise no psychologist. The perception process always includes both addition and subtraction. The reason for this appears to be concretely neurological and not just abstractly "psychological," as we tried to show in Chapter One.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 122 · Location 2468
To give one more illustration of this neurological process: In a well-known experiment—cited, for instance, in Colin Wilson's Criminal History of Mankind, Putnam, New York, 1984 p. 93—Dr. Jerome Bruner measured the nervous path of sound traveling from a cat's ear-drum to the brain. A clicking noise was used as the stimulus to be traced along the nerve-paths. Two mice were later placed where the cat could see them but not get at them. When the click sounded again, there was no electrical impulse recorded at the ear-drum.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 122 · Location 2473
The cat was not just "concentrating" on the mice and "ignoring" the sound; it was literally shutting off the nerve impulse at the ear. There is nothing "occult" about this. The function of the synapse is to act as an off/ on switch: when off it does not transmit a signal, and when on it does transmit.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 122 · Location 2477
The senses pick up about 10,000 bits of information per second, and the synapses automatically turn on and off—passing the information to the brain, or suppressing it—according to habitual (imprinted and conditioned) programs.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 122 · Location 2479
Estimates differ about how much information gets through to the brain, but it is safe to generalize that at least 90 percent is cut off or not-tuned-in.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 122 · Location 2480
When one says in exasperation, "It was as if they couldn't even hear me," one may well be neurologically accurate. If—as is likely—"they" were already rehearsing their brilliant and crushing rebuttal, then they were not hearing a great deal of what you said, for a different "psychological" reason but by the same neurological process by which the White House guests did not hear Roosevelt confess to murder.

Dr. John S. Bell of CERN, the center for nuclear research in Switzerland, published a mathematical demonstration in Physics 1-195 (1964). It is known as Bell's Theorem. It argues, in effect, that while separation in space and time are "real" in some contexts, such separation is "unreal" or unimportant in quantum mechanics.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 125 · Location 2538
Michael Talbot in Mysticism and the New Physics is keen on Bell's Theorem because he thinks it is scientific vindication of the monism of those mystics who have been telling us "All is One" for the last few thousand years.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 125 · Location 2540
Dr. Fritjof Capra, himself a physicist, is equally delighted with Bell and in his The Tao of Physics virtually invites us to convert to Taoism on the basis of Bell's math.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 125 · Location 2541
Gary Zukav in The Dancing Wu Li Masters joins this chorus of affirmation and celebration.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 125 · Location 2543
Another physicist, however. Dr. Heinz Pagels, in The Cosmic Code, insists that, even if sound mathematically, Bell's Theorem is physically meaningless.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 125 · Location 2545
This is what Bell argues in simple terms:

- Highlight(pink) - Page 126 · Location 2547
Imagine a source that emits two photon streams (two "rays of light" in lay language) which are intercepted by two instruments, A and B. These instruments may be as far apart as you like, even at opposite ends of the universe. By a simple deduction from accepted laws of quantum mechanics, Bell shows that whatever property you measure at instrument A, a simultaneous measurement at instrument B will be mathematically complimentary. That is, the reading at instrument B will not only correlate with the reading at A but with the type of reading—which "property" of the photons you measured.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 126 · Location 2552
How startling this is only becomes evident when one reflects that the result is "as if" each photon knows what measurement is being carried out at the other photon, and knows it instantaneously.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 126 · Location 2554
Bell also showed that this kind of non-local correlation, as it is called, should happen with separation in time as well as with separation in space

- Highlight(pink) - Page 126 · Location 2558
it was not entirely a surprise. That quantum mechanics seems to imply such non-local (or non-causal) connectedness had been pointed out by various physicists previously.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 126 · Location 2559
Curiously, the first to point it out was Einstein, in 1935, who said such a non-local connection was "spooky" (which maybe it is) and that it "implied telepathy" (which maybe it does). Einstein concluded that there was something radically wrong with quantum mechanics, if it seemed to lead to such conclusions.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 126 · Location 2561
Dr. Erwin Schrödinger—he of the dead-and-alive cat—noted a similar "monist" implication in quantum mechanics and even said (in his What Is Life?, Chapter 23) that the monist or holistic philosophy of the Upanishads might be more consistent with quantum math than any Western reality-tunnel is.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 126 · Location 2564
Dr. David Bohm made the same point in a celebrated 1952 paper, which was widely discussed.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 127 · Location 2566
It must be stressed that photons are either "particles" of light or "waves" of light—both models are useful—but, anyway, they are the thingamajigs by which light travels.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 127 · Location 2567
There is, therefore, no way any signal can get instantaneously from the photon at instrument A to the photon at instrument B, or vice versa, since signals are defined as energy packets and energy packets move at the speed of light, or at a velocity less than the speed of light, but never faster than the speed of light, according to the best generalizations or "laws" now known.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 127 · Location 2571
This is why the non-local connection seemed "spooky" to Einstein and why it seems to imply monism. The photons behave as if some energy is causing them to be correlated, but there is no energy in physics that moves fast enough to do that job.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 127 · Location 2574
There is a way around such mathematical monstrosities, of course; it is known as the doctrine of "accidents of the formalism." An "accident of the formalism" is something that is mathematically useful, even necessary perhaps to the elegance of the equations, but has no measurable consequence in the experimental world.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 127 · Location 2577
Thus, the most popular way of disposing of Schrödinger's damned cat is to say that this remarkable feline is both dead and alive in the formalism, but there are no cats in the experimental world who will be found in that mixed state.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 127 · Location 2579
A photon or an electron or any other quantum thingamajig "is" a wave sometimes and "is" a particle sometimes, similarly, because we use wave equations sometimes and use particle equations other times. (In the celebrated two-hole experiment, photons act like both waves and particles experimentally, but at different moments. That is a different problem.)

- Highlight(pink) - Page 127 · Location 2582
The multiple-worlds interpretation of the Schrödinger wave equations, similarly, is an "accident of formalism" and to take it literally—as some physicists do—is the mathematical equivalent of an optical illusion, according to this line of thought.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 127 · Location 2584
Thus, those who found Bell's mathematical demonstration simply incredible decided it must be an "accident of the formalism" with no experimental meaning.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 127 · Location 2586
Berkeley, California, 1974—Dr. John Clauser tested Bell's Theorem experimentally. See Capra, previously cited, for details. The damned photons behaved as Bell's math had predicted.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 128 · Location 2588
Every possible objection was raised, of course. Clauser repeated the experiment with more rigorous controls, and got the same result. Aspect in France repeated it. Others repeated it. Within a few years, there were six experiments, of which four supported Bell and two did not and all were being criticized on various technical grounds.

U S. Patent Disclosure 771165 (May 12,1978) by Dr. Jack Sarfatti, Physics/ Consciousness Research Group—prototype of a proposed faster-than-light communication system, based on Dr. Sarfatti's model that, even if energy can't get around faster than light, Bell's math indicates that information is somehow getting around faster than light.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 128 · Location 2606
6 January 1983 New Scientist (London)—two new sets of experiments by Dr. Alain Aspect of the Institut d'Optique Theorique et Appliquée in Orsay, near Paris, are regarded as conclusively vindicating Bell's Theorem.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 129 · Location 2609
Aspect's experimental set-up was as follows:

- Note - Page 129 · Location 2610
Image

- Highlight(pink) - Page 129 · Location 2610
The source is either a mercury atom or a calcium atom, because these emit photons easily. The jagged lines on each side of the source indicate that the diagram is condensed to fit the page—the photons travel a long distance (three meters) before encountering the rest of the apparatus. First they pass through specially-designed switches (which act in 10 nanoseconds, i.e. 10 billionths of a second) and then are polarized and arrive at photon counters activated by the switches.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 129 · Location 2613
The switches are important, because the photon counters thus register only what happens after the photons have passed the switches—i.e. in the last 10 billionths of a second. Since the instruments are six meters apart, no energy-signal can travel in that time from one photon to the other "causing" each to adjust to the other. (That would require exactly 20 billionths of a second.)

- Highlight(pink) - Page 129 · Location 2617
Nonetheless, the photons remain correlated in the way Bell predicts. It is like two ballet dancers at opposite ends of the stage who take up the same positions in the finale without looking at each other (i.e. with no signal passing between them).

- Highlight(pink) - Page 129 · Location 2619
We know how ballet dancers create such "synchronicities," of course. The information is "already in them." It has been fed in by a choreographer. But what sort of choreographer feeds the information to these photons? The question is far from trivial.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 129 · Location 2621
New Scientist (or their Mr. Basil Riley actually) sums up: I should emphasize that this result holds despite there being no interaction between the two separate particles . . . In other words, there appears to be some form of "non-local effect" . . . we must be prepared to consider radically new views of reality without placing locality in a central position.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 129 · Location 2625
Dr. John Gribbin points out in his In Search of Schrödinger's Cat, op. cit. p. 226 that this experiment is, in context, even stronger than it appears at first sight. Out of seven experiments, five have vindicated Bell, while the experiments themselves, under criticism, have successively been more and more exquisitely subtle. A defect in the apparatus should destroy evidence of correlation; it is very hard to imagine—try to imagine it—what a series of incredible defects it would take to somehow cumulatively produce a false correlation where there was none in actuality.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 130 · Location 2631
Dr. Herbert has given me the following popular illustration of what this sort of non-local effect means, adopted from a lecture from Dr. Bell himself: Imagine a man in Mexico City who always wears red socks, and imagine a man in Belgrade who always wears blue socks. Imagine that, in some way, we can "cause" the man in Mexico City to take off his red socks and put on blue socks. If these men acted like Aspect's photons, the man in Belgrade would then, instantaneously—before any news of what happened in Mexico City could reach him—suddenly take off his blue socks and put on red socks. Furthermore, if they were exactly like Aspect's photons, every time we caused one of them to change in this way, the other would still immediately change in the complimentary way.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 130 · Location 2637
You can see why Einstein regarded such non-local effects as spooky. Since no energy moves fast enough to cause them, they are acausal.

20 February 1983 London Sunday Times—interview with Dr. David Bohm, after the latest Aspect experiments. Since Dr. Bohm is considered the most distinguished physicist in London these days, the Times asked him what he thinks it implies. "It may mean," says Dr. Bohm, "that everything in the universe is in a kind of total rapport, so that whatever happens is related to everything else; or it may mean that there is some kind of information that can travel faster than the speed of light; or it may mean that our concepts of space and time have to be modified in some way that we don't now understand."

For convenience, let us call these three choices the Philosophical Monist alternative, the Science Fiction alternative, and the Neo-Kantian alternative. Let us also try to remember that they are not the only three choices.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 136 · Location 2768
The Philosophical Monist alternative (" whatever happens is related to everything else") does seem, on the face of it, to imply the kind of cosmology usually associated with Oriental mysticism. Schrödinger noticed that, as early as 1944, when he wrote that quantum mechanics seems more consistent with Oriental monism than with previous Western, or Aristotelian, habits of dualism

- Highlight(pink) - Page 136 · Location 2770
Dr. Capra's Tao of Physics, whatever else it proves or fails to prove, documents in detail that many Buddhist and Taoist texts also sound remarkably like some modern books on quantum mechanics.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Page 136 · Location 2772 ❗️
This looks pretty threatening to Fundamentalist Materialism, already, but it is even more hair-raising to note that the Monist model also bears a striking and hardly accidental resemblance to both Jung's synchronicity (universal resonance) and Sheldrake's morphogenetic field discussed in the previous chapter—two ideas which the Fundamentalists have repeatedly denounced as "absurd" and "absolutely forbidden" by their Platonic Eternal Laws.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 136 · Location 2777
In fact, Dr. Bohm has explicitly acknowledged that this implication of quantum mechanics inclines him to suspect Sheldrake may be right, after all, despite the condemnations of the Fundamentalists, See "Conversation Between David Bohm and Rupert Sheldrake," Revision, Fall 1982.*

- Highlight(pink) - Page 137 · Location 2781
In the same conversation Dr. Bohm also raises the possibility that the "laws" of the universe are not absolute but are, like everything else, evolving in time. When I first suggested this, I thought I was being whimsical, but Dr. Bohm is serious, and he is considered one of the most brilliant physicists of our time.

____

- Highlight(pink) - Page 125 · Location 2529 ❗️
Alleged "ESP” is absurd, in one common reality-tunnel, because "ESP” acts as if "space" is somewhat unreal. Precognition (also alleged) is equally, or more absurd, because it acts as if "time" is somewhat unreal. Jungian synchronicity (meaningful resonance) is even more absurd than "ESP” or precognition because it acts as if both space and time were unreal. What happens to our own reality-tunnel if we consider that the words "space" and "time" might be, as suggested in Chapter One, human-invented metaphors?

- Highlight(pink) - Page 137 · Location 2787 
Any kind of non-local monism or interconnectedness does somewhat strengthen the case for the "paranormal" insofar as it makes thinkable or possible those trans-time and trans-space linkages which Fundamentalism has declared unthinkable and impossible.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 137 · Location 2790
This can be seen more clearly, and more alarmingly for some, by skipping over such notions as "ESP” and "precognition" and proceeding directly to the Damnedest of the Damned—magic (or, as some prefer, magick).

- Highlight(pink) - Page 137 · Location 2792
What is magic supposed to mean? According to Frazer's classic Golden Bough, magic is a "primitive science" or false science which incorrectly assumes a "law of contagion" whereby "things once in contact continue to influence each other." But that is precisely what the non-local connection asserts, if it asserts anything and is not just mathematical poetry.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 137 · Location 2796
Wait a minute, here. I am not asserting that the non-local connection proves the validity of magic. Magic not only asserts a non-local connection but also asserts that there are known ways by which some humans (shamans or magicians) can exploit this connection to change the world in ways they want.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 137 · Location 2801
Similarly, Jungian synchronicity is not proven by these quantum experiments, but it is put in a context where it seems possible at least, and, if one accepts the monist interpretation here being discussed, not only possible but rather plausible.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 155 · Location 3181
And I think: according to Fundamentalist Materialism, I cannot have a thought that does not use energy in my brain—the moving energy in the brain is the thought, Dr. Carl Sagan insists—And then—if the damned non-local connection means something and is not just a mixture of mathematical poetry and "coincidental" hallucinations in various physics laboratories—Universe will respond non-locally to my thought. Maybe it will average out to a microscopic or invisible response most of the time, but occasionally things may wobble and jump visibly. And pranksters who seem to be very, very clever—or people who, against Authoritative fiat, experiment on their own—trying to project energies—trying to heal, I hope, and also, I fear, in some cases, trying to harm—And Universe averages it all out most of the time—but occasionally—wobbles and jumps—fires and mutations—fluctuations—and, one case in a billion maybe, the energy is fired precisely as a weapon

- Highlight(pink) - Page 137 · Location 2804❗️
Before leaving the monist interpretation, it is amusing to note—or, for some, it is terrifying to note—that if one accepts as meaningful both Bell's Theorem and the currently fashionable "Big Bang" cosmology, the monism that results is of a Buddhist or Hegelian "hardness." If all particles were together in one place at the first nanosecond of the Big Bang, then, by Bell's Theorem they are all still non-locally connected.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Page 138 · Location 2811❗️
Super-determinism also, I think, reduces the quarrel between materialism and idealism (or mentalism) to meaninglessness. As some Buddhists noted long ago, both the propositions "all is matter" and "all is mind" become pointless if all is connected monistically. You can only say, then, that "all is ineffable," which is the dominant trend in Mahayana Buddhist philosophy. As the semanticist, Korzybski, often said, at this stage one cannot speak but only point—which is what Zen Buddhists often do.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 138 · Location 2815
Dr. Clauser did not endorse super-determinism; he just included it in a chart of possible interpretations of non-locality. The chart is in Zukav's Dancing Wu Li Masters, op. cit.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Page 138 · Location 2818❗️
Onward to Dr. Bohm's second alternative—"Information that can travel faster than light"—the Science Fiction alternative, I have called it—Well, if information can get around faster than light, and no energy can get around faster than light, then we either have to think of some ghostly kind of information that travels without an energy to carry it—and parapsychology rears its head again—or else we have to think that the information isn't exactly traveling but is somehow already everywhere.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 138 · Location 2823
The second choice is, in fact, the one Dr. Bohm has chosen to defend as his own favorite model. He defends it ably in Wholeness and the Implicate Order, op. cit.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 138 · Location 2824
This model is based on the proposition that energy can either be enfolded (implicate) or unfolded (explicate). The enfolded energy of the universe contains the information on which the system operates; the unfolded energy is programmed, as it were, by this enfolded, implicate energy.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 139 · Location 2827
If this is too abstract, try the following metaphor, given to me by Dr. Sarfatti, the man with the FTL prototype: Imagine that the universe known to us is like a great big jumbo computer. Imagine that each lesser system is a somewhat smaller computer within the Big Computer. Work your way on down to the smallest system now accepted—the quark—and imagine that as tiny little mini-mini-mini-computer. Now the hardware of each computer (Bohm's unfolded, explicate order) is localized in space-time—each part is here, not there, and now, not then. But the software (Bohm's enfolded, implicate order) is nonlocally everywhere-everywhen, here and there, now and then. Now you understand non-locality, according to Dr. Sarfatti.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 139 · Location 2837
Here is another metaphor, used by Dr. Bohm himself, to explain the implicate order: I pick up the phone and call you. My speech is unfolded or explicate in the form of sound waves as it leaves my lips. The telephone transmitter enfolds the form into the implicate order of electrical impulses and they travel in that form to the receiver on your phone. The receiver then unfolds the implicate order of electrical impulses into the explicate order of sound waves again and you hear me speaking.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 139 · Location 2842
This metaphor may make "implicate" and "explicate" more clear than Sarfatti's metaphor, but as Bohm himself admits it still involves movement in space, and his concept of implicate order is that it does not move in space but is everywhere already.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 139 · Location 2844
If you can think of the implicate and explicate being enfolded and unfolded like speech on a phone, and also of the implicate as the nonlocal software of all local or unfolded hardware, you are fairly close to what the Bohm model means, I think.

IF FTL ever does get off the ground we will be in the position of the young lady in the celebrated limerick: There was a young lady named Bright Whose speed was much faster than light She departed one day In a relative way And returned on the previous night

- Highlight(pink) - Page 140 · Location 2854
That is, if Dr. Sarfatti or Dr. Herbert or somebody someday sends out a real faster-than-light message—or if one of the "dozen or more" FTL systems Dr. Herbert mentions turns out to work—we will shortly be living in the Grandfather Paradox of Science Fiction. That paradox is: If I travel backward in time and murder my grandfather before he mates—never mind why I would want to do such a thing—then my father would never be here, and I would never be here—and then—and then? And then we either see from this example that time-travel is a logical contradiction, or else we have to return to the multiple universes of the EWG model—Gribbin's "everything is real"—There is a universe in which I am here, and a universe in which I am not here, and by traveling back and doing the dirt to poor Grand-dad I have navigated from universe-1 to universe-2. Grand-dad, meanwhile, like Schrödinger's cat, is both dead and alive. But so am I. And so are you.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 140 · Location 2862
I don't see how the New Fundamentalism can survive that alternative. Ultimately, it leads to the possibility that we can travel far enough back to intervene at the Big Bang and create universes with different laws, including every chaotic and cock-eyed law that cannot exist in the Fundamentalist's universe.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 140 · Location 2865
Maybe we will do it, and therefore in a sense have done it. Maybe the present "universe" of experience is midway between the Ideal Platonic Universe of Eternal Laws the Fundamentalists posit and one of the cock-eyed universes created by our future meddling with the past. That may explain some of the weirder yams in this book, if you think about it . .

But before we leave information faster-than-light and information therefore going backwards-in-time—If that is possible, then "precognition" is also possible.

Dr. Bohm's third alternative—which I have called neo-Kantian—"our concepts of space and time will have to be modified"—This seems to lead back to the monist alternative, in which "space" and "time" are not quite real, or are only "appearances"—Or it leads to even wilder alternatives, which nobody has thought out yet.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 141 · Location 2886
Because, as Kant pointed out, and as Einstein demonstrated even more tellingly, our ideas of "space" and "time" are interconnected with our ideas of "mass" and "matter"—connected both by definitions and by mathematical equations—If our ideas of "space" and "time" change, then, our ideas of "matter" will also have to change, and the Fundamentalist Materialists will have to become Fundamentalist Somethingelseists.

In a sense, Bohm's three alternatives are interconvertible. That is, if all things are in harmony or resonance, then the universe will behave as if information is getting around faster than light, or is already everywhere; and if "space" and "time" are somewhat unreal, or only real in some contexts, then it will again be as if information is everywhere simultaneously; and if information is so ubiquitous, it will be as if space-time is somewhat unreal or is an aspect of a deeper implicate order; and if there is an implicate order, it will be as if space-time is somewhat unreal and/ or as if information is dashing madly backwards-forwards-and-sideways in time instantaneously.

It appears again to be a question of which metaphors we prefer.

One technical point should be raised here. According to the Copenhagen Interpretation—so-called because it was devised by Dr. Niels Bohr and his colleagues at the University of Copenhagen, 1926-28—there is a difference between science and "reality." Unfortunately, the Copenhagen Interpretation is so subtle in its ramifications that no two physicists seem to understand it in exactly the same way. Dr. Bohr once stated it in the words, "It used to be thought that physics refers to the universe, but we now know that it refers to what we can say about that universe." (Italics his.) That is, if I understand him, "the universe" is a philosophic concept—it generally implies "the real universe," with all the philosophical problems of "reality" thereby invoked. What we can say about the universe, however, refers to our math and our experiments

—the current reality-tunnel that seems useful to us, in explaining the currently tuned-in, in my terminology. We should remember that we are referring to the latter—our semantic systems—and not confuse it with the former. The menu is not the meal.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 131 · Location 2649
Dr. Eugene Wigner, on the other hand, has said, or has been misunderstood to have said, that the Copenhagen Interpretation means that the universe is being created by our thoughts and experiments. I suspect that he meant the universe-experienced-by-us is being created that way, and that "the universe" is something we can't know about.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 131 · Location 2653
Gribbin, in In Search of Schrödinger’s Cat, op. cit. begins by declaring boldly (page 1) that the Copenhagen view means "nothing is real" but he quickly sobers himself and says more restrainedly (page 4) that "' Reality' in the everyday sense is not a good way to think about (physics)."

- Highlight(pink) - Page 131 · Location 2657
Dr, Nick Herbert, in several conversations, has insisted that the Copenhagen Interpretation amounts to "Christian Science," since he takes it as denying that there is a real universe. But he doesn't like the Copenhagen Interpretation. Dr. David Bohm, in a recent conversation with me, described the Copenhagen view as one that "denies that we can make statements about actuality." I think he was consciously avoiding, or trying to avoid, the philosophical problems of "reality," when he said "actuality" instead.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 131 · Location 2662
You might suspect that I am sympathetic to Copenhagenism, insofar as I understand it; in fact, that is why I have written about the correlation of Bell's Theorem with "the experimental world" and have not attempted to say anything about its correlation with "the real world," whatever that is, or "the real universe," whatever that is, or "ultimate reality," whatever that is.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 131 · Location 2667
I take it that "experimental reality" or "the experimental world" or "the experimental reality-tunnel" is part of "existential reality," i.e. what people experience; and that it is a large part of experience, for those who spend their lives as experimentalists; but a relatively small part for those who spend their time writing music or poetry.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 131 · Location 2670
I further take it that, whatever categories we use to organize our experience in speech or thought, these categories will contain metaphoric elements; and that to talk about this process of creating metaphors will necessarily create more metaphors—metaphors about metaphors, in fact. Therefore, I think it reasonable to assume that the conflicting versions of the Copenhagen Interpretation are "really" trying to say the same thing, but the various physicists create different metaphors in trying to say it.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 132 · Location 2674
Thus, when Bohr distinguishes so exquisitely between "the universe" and "what we can say about the universe," he fundamentally means the same thing as Gribbin means when he says "nothing is real."

- Highlight(pink) - Page 132 · Location 2676
Both can be restated in a middle or compromise proposition, to wit: Nothing we can say about the universe is the "real" universe. Wigner, hopefully, also means that we are creating what we can say about the universe, which is not the "real" universe.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 132 · Location 2678
When Herbert says the Copenhagenists don't believe in the "real" universe, this is also, maybe, what Bohm means when he says the Copenhagenists deny that we can talk about "actuality."

Mathematical physics provides the most useful emic realities available to us, but no emic reality is etic (non-verbal) reality.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 132 · Location 2681
And I hope this collectively means that science should be considered as a set of models for talking about experiments, as art is a set of models for communicating evaluations, and that neither these kinds of models nor any other kind of models should be confused with ultimate "reality" or "all' of ultimate "reality," whatever that is. We can talk meaningfully about the tuned-in but not about the not-yet-tuned-in.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 134 · Location 2730
If the non-local connection can be considered a model in science, on the grounds that it contains correlations between experiments and mathematics, which is what scientific models are supposed to contain, then it implies something about the-universe-we-experience, or the tuned-in even if it does not solve philosophical problems about the not-tuned-in, which are questions outside science. That, I think—or I hope—is what Copenhagenism means.

If by some miracle I have managed to make sense out of this issue, where physicists themselves seem to have trouble understanding one another, the basic point of Copenhagenism seems to be similar to my own Nietzschean-existentialist view that the nonverbal or preverbal world never contained "meters" or "kilograms" or "ergs of energy" or "photons" or "good" or "evil" or "beauty" or "meaning" until primate nervous systems (" human minds") put them there as systems of classification.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 133 · Location 2702
I think, but the Fundamentalists manage to forget that the Copenhagen view applies this "model agnosticism" (as it is sometimes called) to every kind of model in science (or outside science, sometimes) and this specifically includes the allegedly absolute "laws" on which their own dogmas are based

- Highlight(pink) - Page 133 · Location 2709
The Fundamentalists, it seems to me, are talking theologically (in absolutes) almost all the time, and resort to modern scientific epistemology (Copenhagenian agnosticism) only when a new model affronts their prejudices. They are, in effect, saying "The models we want to believe are 'basic physical laws' and hence absolutes" (see Prof. Bunge) "but the models we don't want to believe are—only models."

John Gribbin, In Search of Schrödinger's Cat, op. cit. p. 254 decides after much musing that the non-local connection implies that "either everything is real or nothing is real." That is, Gribbin's own analysis leads to the conclusion that we either accept the EWG multi-universe model, in which everything that can happen does happen—"everything is real"—the model that many other physicists regard as mathematical surrealism—or else we must retreat to the flavor of Copenhagenism which the Fundamentalist Materialists want and which Gribbin, more honestly than they, admits is tantamount to solipsism—"nothing is real."

Once again; I am not asserting a dogma in contradiction to Fundamentalist Materialism. I am merely indicating that—when the experts cannot agree and even seem to misunderstand each other at times—agnosticism is not only scientifically more appropriate, and more in line with that virtue of humility which most sages and philosophers have urged, but a matter of simple honesty with oneself.
