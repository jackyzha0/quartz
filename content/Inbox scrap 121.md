THE GOSPEL OF THOMAS WITH THE GREEK GOSPEL OF THOMAS

THE SECRET BOOK OF JOHN

170

When I, John, heard this, I turned away from the temple and went to a mountainous and barren place. I was distressed within, and I asked how the Savior was chosen:

Why was he sent into the world by his Father?

Who is his Father who sent him?

To what kind of eternal realm4 shall we go?

And why did he tell us, when he spoke,

that this eternal realm [to which we shall go]

is modeled after the incorruptible realm,

but he did not teach us what kind of aeon that one is?

171

I am [the Father], I am the Mother, I am the Child. I am the incorruptible and the undefiled one. [Now I have come] to teach you what is, what [was], and what is going to come, that you may [understand] what is invisible and what is visible; and to teach you about the [unshakable generation of] the perfect [human].

171

The One7 is a sovereign that has nothing over it. It is God and Parent, Father8 of the All, the invisible one that is over the All, that is incorruptible, that is pure light at which no eye can gaze.

1284

8. The text reads “Father” (eit), here and below, for the transcendent Great Invisible Spirit. The translation “Parent” is incorporated here to emphasize that the divine parent transcends gender categories, and the translation of this section seeks to provide an accurate means of addressing issues of gender in the Secret Book of John. For a slightly different translation of a portion of this section, see the note to Allogenes the Stranger 62–64.

171

The One is the Invisible Spirit. We should not think of it as a god or like a god. For it is greater than a god, because it has nothing over it and no [3] lord above it. It does not [exist] within anything inferior [to it, since everything] exists within it, [for it established] itself.9 It is eternal, since it does not need anything. For it is absolutely complete. It has never lacked anything in order to be completed by it. Rather, it is always absolutely complete in light.

171

The One is

illimitable, since there is nothing before it to limit it,

unfathomable, since there is nothing before it to fathom it,

immeasurable, since there was nothing before it to measure it,

invisible, since nothing has seen it,

eternal, since it exists eternally,

unutterable, since nothing could comprehend it to utter it,

unnamable, since there is nothing before it to give it a name.

171

The One is the immeasurable light, pure, holy, immaculate. It is unutterable, and is perfect in incorruptibility. Not that it is just perfection, or blessedness, or divinity: it is much greater.

The One is not corporeal and it is not incorporeal.

The One is not large and it is not small.

It is impossible to say,

How much is it?

What [kind is it]?10

For no one can understand it.

172

The One is not among the things that exist, but it is much greater. Not that it is greater. Rather, as it is in itself, it is not a part of the aeons or time. For whatever is part of a realm was once prepared by another. Time was not allotted to it, since it receives nothing from anyone: what would be received would be on loan. The one who is first does not need to receive anything from another. It beholds itself in [4] its light.

172

The One is majestic and has an immeasurable purity.

The One is a realm that gives a realm,

life that gives life,

a blessed one that gives blessedness,

knowledge that gives knowledge,11

a good one that gives goodness,

mercy that gives mercy and redemption,

grace that gives grace.

Not that the One possesses this. Rather, the One gives immeasurable and incomprehensible light.

1287

11. Gnosis.

172

What shall I tell you about it? Its eternal realm is incorruptible, at peace, dwelling in silence, at rest, before everything.

It is the head of all realms, and it is the one who sustains them through its goodness.

We would not know [what is ineffable], we would not understand what is immeasurable, were it not for the one who has come from the Father. This is the one who has told these things to us [alone].

172

He reflects on his image everywhere,

177

Now, Sophia, who is the Wisdom of Insight and who constitutes an aeon,43 conceived of a thought from herself,

177

She wanted to bring forth something like herself, without the consent of the Spirit, who had not given approval, without her partner and without his consideration.44 The male did not give approval. She did not find her partner, and she considered this without the Spirit’s consent and without the knowledge of her partner. Nonetheless, she gave birth. [10] And because of the invincible power within her, her thought was not an idle thought. Something came out of her that was imperfect and different in appearance from her, for she had produced it without her partner. It did not resemble its mother and was misshapen.

177

She cast it away from her, outside that realm so that none of the immortals would see it. She had produced it ignorantly.

She surrounded it with a bright cloud and put a throne in the middle of the cloud so that no one would see it except the holy Spirit, who is called the Mother of the living. She named her offspring Yaldabaoth.

177

This is the first ruler, the archon who took great power from his mother. Then he left her and moved away from the place where he was born. He took control and created for himself other aeons with luminous fire, which still exists. He mated with the mindlessness46 in him and produced authorities for himself:

178

he did not give away any of the power of the light he had taken from his mother. For he is ignorant darkness.

178

He is wicked in the mindlessness within him. He said, “I am God and there is no other god beside me,”54 since he did not know from where his own strength had come.

1330

54. Isaiah 45:5–6, 21; 46:9.

178

Yaldabaoth has many [12] faces, more than all of these, so that he could show whatever face he wanted when he was among the seraphim.59 He shared his fire with them, and lorded it over them because of the glorious power he had from his mother’s light. That is why he called himself God and defied the place from which he came.

179

When he saw creation surrounding him, and the throng of angels around him that had come forth from him, he said to them, “I am a jealous god and there is no other god beside me.”65

But by announcing this, he suggested to the angels with him that there is another god. For if there were no other god, of whom would he be jealous?

179

Sophia Repents (13, 13–14, 13)

180

The Creation of Adam (15, 1–19, 10)

180

Yaldabaoth77 said to the authorities with him, “Come, let’s create a human being after the image of God and with a likeness to ourselves, so that this human image may give us light.”78

181

They created a being like the perfect first human, and said, “Let’s call it Adam, that its name may give us power of light.”79

183

Adam Receives Spirit and Life (19, 10–20, 28)

183

All the angels and demons worked together until they fashioned the psychical body. But for a long time their creation did not stir or move at all.

183

When the Mother wanted to take back the power she had relinquished to the first ruler, she prayed to the most merciful Mother-Father of the All. With a sacred command the Mother-Father90 sent five luminaries down upon the place of the angels of the first ruler. They advised him so that they might recover the mother’s power.

183

They said to Yaldabaoth, “Breathe some of your spirit into the face of Adam, and the body will arise.”

184

He breathed his spirit into Adam.91 The spirit is the power of his mother, but he did not realize this, because he lives in ignorance. The Mother’s power went out of Yaldabaoth and into the psychical body that had been made to be like the one who is from the beginning.

The body moved and became powerful. And it was enlightened.

184

The Imprisonment of Humanity (20, 28–22, 28)

184

The human being Adam was revealed through the bright shadow within. And Adam’s ability to think was greater than that of all the creators. When they looked up, they saw that Adam’s ability to think was greater, and they devised a plan with the whole throng of archons and angels. They took fire, earth, [21] and water, and combined them with the four fiery winds.96 They wrought them together and made a great commotion.97

185

The rulers brought Adam into the shadow of death so that they might produce a figure again, from earth, water, fire, and the spirit that comes from matter98—that is, from the ignorance of darkness, and desire, and their own phony spirit. This figure is the cave for remodeling the body that these criminals put on the human, the fetter of forgetfulness.99 Adam became a mortal person, the first to descend and the first to become estranged.

Enlightened Insight within Adam, however, was rejuvenating Adam’s mind.

185

The archons took Adam and put Adam in paradise. They said, “Eat,” meaning, Do so in a leisurely manner.100 But in fact their pleasure is bitter and their beauty is perverse. Their pleasure is a trap, their trees are a sacrilege, their fruit is deadly poison, and their promise is death.

They put their tree of life in the middle of paradise.101

185

I102 shall teach you what the secret of their life is—the plan they devised together, the nature of their spirit. The root of their tree is bitter, its branches are death, its shadow is hatred, a trap is in its leaves, its blossom is bad ointment, its fruit is death, desire is its seed, and it blossoms in darkness. The dwelling place of those who taste [22] of it is the underworld, and darkness is their resting place.

185

But the archons lingered in front of what they call the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which is enlightened Insight,103 so that Adam might not behold its fullness104 and recognize his shameful nakedness.

185

But I105 was the one who induced them to eat.

I106 said to the Savior, “Lord, was it not the serpent that instructed Adam to eat?”

The Savior laughed and said, The serpent instructed them to eat of the wickedness of sexual desire and destruction so that Adam might be of use to the serpent.

1381

105. The Savior, here Jesus.

185

The first ruler107 knew Adam was disobedient to him because of enlightened Insight within Adam, which made Adam stronger of mind than he. He wanted to recover the power that he himself had passed on to Adam. So he brought deep sleep upon Adam.

I said to the Savior, “What is this deep sleep?”

The Savior said, It is not as Moses wrote and you heard. He said in his first book,108 “He put Adam to sleep.”109 Rather, this deep sleep was a loss of sense. Thus the first ruler said through the prophet, “I shall make their minds sluggish, that they may neither understand nor discern.”110

186

The Creation of Eve (22, 28–23, 35)

184

At once the rest of [20] the powers became jealous. Although Adam came into being through all of them, and they gave their power to this human, Adam was more intelligent than the creators and the first ruler. When they realized that Adam was enlightened and could think more clearly than they and was stripped of evil,92 they took and threw Adam into the lowest part of the whole material realm.

187

Yaldabaoth Defiles Eve (23, 35–25, 16)

188

On Human Destiny (25, 16–30, 11)

188

I said to the Savior, “Lord, will all the souls then be led safely into pure light?”

He answered and said to me, These are great matters that have arisen in your mind, and it is difficult to explain them to anyone except those of the unshakable generation.

188

Those upon whom the spirit of life will descend and whom the spirit will empower will be saved, and will become perfect and worthy of greatness, and will be cleansed there of all evil and the anxieties of wickedness, since they are no longer anxious for anything except the incorruptible alone, and concerned with that from this moment on, without anger, jealousy, envy, desire, or greed for anything.

They are affected by nothing but being in the flesh alone, and they wear the flesh as they look forward to a time when they will be met [26] by those who receive them. Such people are worthy of the incorruptible, eternal life and calling. They endure everything and bear everything so as to finish the contest127 and receive eternal life.

188

I said to him, “Lord, will the souls of people be [rejected]128 who have not done these things, but upon whom the power and the spirit of life have descended?”

He answered and said to me, If the spirit descends upon them,129 by all means they will be saved and transformed. Power will descend upon every person, for without it no one could stand.130 After birth, if the spirit of life grows and power comes and strengthens that soul, no one will be able to lead it astray with evil actions. But people upon whom the false spirit descends are misled by it and go astray.

188

I said, “Lord, where will their souls go when they leave their flesh?”

He laughed and said to me, The soul in which there is more power than the contemptible spirit is strong. She escapes from evil, and through the intervention of the incorruptible one, she is saved and is taken up to eternal rest.131

189

I said, “Lord, where will the souls go of people who have not known to whom they belong?”

He said to me, The contemptible spirit has [27] grown stronger in such people while they were going astray. This spirit lays a heavy burden on the soul, leads her into evil deeds, and hurls her down into forgetfulness. After the soul leaves the body, she is handed over to the authorities who have come into being through the archon. They bind her with chains and throw her into prison.132 They go around with her until she awakens from forgetfulness and acquires knowledge. This is how she attains perfection and is saved.

189

I said, “Lord, how can the soul become younger and return into its mother’s womb,133 or into the human?”

He was glad when I asked him about this, and he said to me, You are truly blessed, for you have understood. This soul will be made to follow another soul in whom the spirit of life dwells, and she is saved through that one. Then she will not be thrust into flesh again.

THE GOSPEL OF THOMAS WITH THE GREEK GOSPEL OF THOMAS

193

In contrast to the New Testament gospels, which focus upon the crucifixion and resurrection as they set forth a gospel of the cross, the Gospel of Thomas presents a figure of Jesus who does not die for anyone’s sins on the cross and does not rise from the dead on the third day. Rather, in the tradition of Jewish teachers of wisdom, the Jesus of the Gospel of Thomas utters wise sayings, one after another, and through these sayings the Gospel of Thomas proclaims a gospel of wisdom.

204

1

And he4 said, “Whoever discovers the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death.”5

1439

5. Cf. Sirach 39:1–3; John 8:51–52.

(1) Jesus said,6 “Let one who seeks not stop seeking until one finds. (2) When one finds, one will be troubled. (3) When one is troubled, one will marvel (4) and will reign over all.”7

Note: per Bhikku Bodhi: To undo this process involves a commitment to truth that is often unsettling, but in the long run proves exhilarating and liberating

204

3

(1) Jesus said, “If your leaders say to you, ‘Look, the kingdom is in heaven,’ then the birds of heaven will precede you. (2) If they say to you, ‘It is in the sea,’8 then the fish will precede you. (3) Rather, the kingdom is inside you and it is outside you.9

1443

9. Cf. Luke 17:20–21; Gospel of Thomas 113; Manichaean Psalm Book 160.

204

(4) “When you know yourselves, then you will be known, [33] and you will understand that you are children of the living Father. (5) But if you do not know yourselves, then you dwell in poverty, and you are poverty.”10

204

4

(1) Jesus said, “The person old in days will not hesitate to ask a little child seven days old11 about the place of life, and that person will live.12 (2) For many of the first will be last13 (3) and will become a single one.”

1447

13. Cf. Matthew 20:16 (Q); Luke 13:30 (Q); Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Barnabas 6:13.

204

(1) Jesus said, “Know what is in front of your face, and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to you.14 (2) For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed.”15

1449

15. Cf. Mark 4:22; Luke 8:17; Matthew 10:26 (Q); Luke 12:2 (Q). On the last portion of the saying, cf. Gospel of Thomas 6:5–6. P. Oxy. 654.31 adds “and nothing buried that [will not be raised].”

1451

17. This is the negative formulation of the golden rule.

204

7

(1) Jesus said, “Blessed is the lion that the human will eat, so that the lion becomes human. (2) And cursed20 is the human that the lion will eat, and the lion will become human.”21

1454

20. Or “foul.”

21. Here the lion seems to symbolize what is passionate and bestial in human experience. A person may consume the lion or be consumed by it. Cf. Plato Republic 588e–589b.

204

10

Jesus said, “I have thrown fire upon the world, and look, I am watching it until it blazes.”25

1459

25. Cf. Luke 12:49 (Q?); Pistis Sophia 141.

204

11

1471

37. Cf. John 10:30.

204

16

(1) Jesus said, “Perhaps people think that I have come to impose peace upon the world. (2) They do not know that I have come to impose conflicts upon the earth: fire, sword, war. (3) For there will be five [36] in a house: there will be three against two and two against three, father against son and son against father, (4) and they will stand alone.”38

1472

38. Or “as solitaries” (Coptic monakhos). Cf. Matthew 10:34–36 (Q); Luke 12:49 (Q?), 50, 51–53 (Q).

204

17

Jesus said, “I shall give you what no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, what no hand has touched, what has not arisen in the human heart.”39

1473

39. Cf. 1 Corinthians 2:9; Isaiah 64:4; Apocalypse of Elijah or Secrets (Apocrypha) of Elijah; Plutarch How the Young Person Should Study Poetry 17e; Prayer of the Apostle Paul A; Gospel of Judas 47.

204

18

(1) The disciples said to Jesus, “Tell us how our end will be.”40

  

(2) Jesus said, “Have you discovered the beginning, then, so that you are seeking the end? For where the beginning is the end will be. (3) Blessed is one who stands at the beginning: that one will know the end and will not taste death.”41

Note: the end and begging are one in the same, and constantly happening. The universe is in a constant state of creation and distruction

1474

40. Cf. Matthew 24:3; Mark 13:3–4; Luke 21:7.

41. Cf. Gospel of Thomas 49.

204

20

(1) The disciples said to Jesus, “Tell us what heaven’s kingdom is like.”

  

(2) He said to them, “It is like a mustard seed. (3) <It>45 is the smallest of all seeds, (4) but when it falls on prepared soil, it produces a large plant and becomes a shelter for birds of heaven.”46

1480

46. Cf. Matthew 13:31–32 (Q); Luke 13:18–19 (Q); Mark 4:30–32.

204

22

(1) Jesus saw some babies nursing. (2) He said to his disciples, “These nursing babies are like those who enter the kingdom.”

  

(3) They said to him, “Then shall we enter the kingdom as babies?”

  

(4) Jesus said to them, “When you make the two into one, and when you make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner, and the upper like the lower, (5) and when you make male and female into a single one, so that the male will not be male nor the female be female, (6) when you make eyes in place of an eye, a hand in place of a hand, a foot in place of a foot, an image in place of an image, (7) then you will enter [the kingdom].”52[38]

(1) Jesus said, “You see the speck that is in your sibling’s eye, but you do not see the beam that is in your own eye. (2) When you take the beam out of your own eye, then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your sibling’s eye.58

1492

58. Cf. Matthew 7:3–5 (Q); Luke 6:41–42 (Q).

204

28

(1) Jesus said, “I took my stand in the midst of the world, and in flesh I appeared to them.60 (2) I found them all drunk, and I did not find any of them thirsty. (3) My soul ached for the children of humanity,61 because they are blind in their hearts and do not see, for they came into the world empty, and they also seek to depart from the world empty. (4) But now they are drunk. When they shake off their wine, then they will repent.”

204

51

Here the female may symbolize what is earthly and perishable and the male what is heavenly and imperishable, so that the female becoming male means that all who are mortal and of this world, men and women alike, become immortal and divine. Gospel of Thomas 22 uses gender categories in a somewhat different way but for similar purposes. Cf. Hippolytus Refutation of All Heresies 5.8.44; Clement of Alexandria Excerpts from Theodotus 79; First Revelation of James 41; Zostrianos 131; also Second Discourse of Great Seth 65, and Gospel of Philip 58, on the Valentinian concept of the female images of all of us being joined to the male angels in final union.
