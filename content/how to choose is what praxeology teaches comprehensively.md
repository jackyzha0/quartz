How to choose and why to choose a certain end are what praxeology attempts to answer comprehensively.

Praxeology is a science because it concerns itself of the outside world.

It makes suggestions on how and why to choose a certain action based on objective phenomena happening in the world. But it does not compel you (it is amoral; [[Amoralism]]).

What to choose is something that you determine:

- By reason and
- By factors beyond reason

Determining what you want is a task you uniquely are given to answer given the existence of consciousness and free will.
