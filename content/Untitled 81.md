When do you guys know it’s appropriate to talk about mysticism to others? Are you ever afraid it will dismantle peoples closely help beliefs and cause anxiety, existential crisis, depression, etc., and do more harm than good? Do you just let people discover this stuff on there own?

I personally always find myself not wanting to say anything.

But I that case how would you free all beings from suffering?
