But how then does poetry seep into prose? How to write prose like a poet? Is it about the arrangement of sentences? Scenes? Letting go of clear transitions?

With [[Ocean Vuong]] in [[On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Vuong]], I noticed the following:
- He puts paragraph together like a collage.
- He intersperses two images in one paragraph or one sentence (e.g., describes a beautiful day with his mom then suddenly drops an image of her mom hurting him)
