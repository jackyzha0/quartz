## Yinyang  # 

- alternative name: duad (as apposed to [[Monad]])
- [[Dependent Origination]]
- the conflict between these divides is the fuel that moves the universe. Any view of the world must include them, because a universe without these dynamics simply couldn’t exist. HIggs, John. (2021). [[William Blake vs The World Chapter 4 WITHOUT CONTRARIES IS NO PROGRESSION]] (p. 68). New York, NY: _Penguin Random House_.
- [[Yin]] and [[yang]] is a concept originated in ancient Chinese philosophy that describes how obviously opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another.
- It becomes sensible from an initial [quiescence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quiescence "wikt:quiescence") or emptiness ([wuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuji_(philosophy) "Wuji (philosophy)"), sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until [quiescence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quiescence "wikt:quiescence") is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. 
- Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.
- It is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a [mutual whole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-wellfounded_mereology "Non-wellfounded mereology") (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is to postulate the notion of a race with only women or only men; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, women and men together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood.
- Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky—an intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness
- The cycles of the seasons and of plants that progresses or entropies depending on the season until summer where it seeks to procure even healthier leaves, the whittling (entropy) of the plant is in autumn, the degrown plants (destruction) is in winter, the growth (creating) of the plant or tree during spring is where it's gaining or progressing, fully progressed occurs during summer, summer seeks stability as it seeks to keep (progress) the leaves and branches that are healthy, growth and progress reaching its end point of a cycle. And creation as part of yang, and destruction as part of yin, progress on one side (yang) and entropy on the other side (yin), is represented in the cycles.
- [Taiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiji_(philosophy) "Taiji (philosophy)") or Tai chi (simplified Chinese: 太极; traditional Chinese: 太極; pinyin: _tàijí_; lit. 'great pole') is a Chinese cosmological term for the "Supreme Ultimate" state of undifferentiated absolute and infinite potential, the oneness before duality, from which yin and yang originate. In the cosmology pertaining to yin and yang, the material energy, which this universe has created itself out of, is also referred to as [qi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi "Qi"). It is believed that the organization of qi in this cosmology of yin and yang has formed many things.
- It also represents the content occurrence of simultaneous creation and destruction
