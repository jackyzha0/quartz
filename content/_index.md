## Why Quartz?
Hosting a public digital garden isn't easy. There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.

I've personally found that 
1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere
2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations
3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*

> “He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming

I was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.

**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.
