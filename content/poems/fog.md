The rain that should have fallen  
hours ago is now a thick fog  
crawling beside me at Ela Ave.  

As churchgoers sing,  
two girls in green shirts,  
twins perhaps,  
cross the street with ponytails  
prancing behind their heads.  

A German Shepherd on a leash  
pulls the bigger girl toward her father  
also being pulled by a similar dog.  

I trail behind them  
from a good distance  
careful not to disturb  
their most precious affair.  

But surrendering to my desire  
to eavsdrop I came nearer  
only to smell the funniest of smells:  

Fresh dog breath and saliva  
mixed with fog.
