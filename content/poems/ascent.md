You will find your way  
amidst the chaotic turbulence  
of your midnight soul.  

Walk through the path  
of valor,  
of wholeness,  
of divinity.  

Until the morning blows its clarion,  
echoing what is at the depths  
of who you truly are.  

So get up,  
pick your shattered pieces,  
light up a candle,  
and begin  
your eternal  
ascent.
