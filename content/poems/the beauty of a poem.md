Is not in the words chosen  
Or the rhythm  
Or metaphors  
Or syllables  
Or in the sounds  
Of hands applauding  
From behind the reader’s eyes  

It is not even in the breath  
That flows within the poet  
As he breathes out the words  

No, we cannot see for sure  
for the beauty of a poem  
He alone sees it  
No one else can  

And it has to be that way  
For he who cannot see beauty  
by himself  
Cannot show the world
