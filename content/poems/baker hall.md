You were once an overseer  
of starving women and children behind wires  
walking with their bones bursting out of their skins  
stench of burning flesh blending  
with the sacred smoke of incense  
on every mass held by every priest.  

You stay while all are gone  
standing still here while all are lost  
still looking, still listening  
you overseer of forgotten souls  
your four corners still intact  
as if the dead you mock.  

And yet I see your sad windows  
tired eyes to the past  
tired eyes to things we haven't seen  
things we hope we'll never see.  

Why are you still here?  
When will you join the thousand souls  
that once walked inside your walls?  

You Baker Hall  
Oh, most enduring  
of all the monsters built  
on my mother's bosom.
