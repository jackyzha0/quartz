I hear the tiny drops of rain  
dropping one by one  
and together over the large  
grown leaves of the noni.  

They mumble a silent little prayer  
for a sunnier day because  
the sky has been so dark  
for a very long time now.  

If the rain could only speak  
what will it tell me?  
And what if it does speak  
and its language is these tiny drops?  

And by staying put on this mat  
spread on this wooden floor  
where I sit cross-legged  
listening intently to whatever comes  

I might, if I'm ever fortunate,  
hear a whisper of a lifetime—  
the rain speaking a barely audible  
"I love you."
