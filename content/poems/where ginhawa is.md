Where there is rest I am there  
Where the breath is welcome I am there  
Where peace of mind flourishes I am there  
Where friends gather in joy I am there  
Where matter and soul combine let me be there  
Where play is encouraged I am there  
Where adventure awaits I am there  
Where learning never ends I am there  
Where art colors the air I am entwined  
Where love reigns I am a servant  

Ginhawa is my purpose  
And everything ultimately points to it  
Where ginhawa is, there I'll reside  
Until the end of my days
