## Summary

I spent the first week of March strengthening the concept of my client's research proposal on inclusion of people with disabilities. After delivering the final version of the draft, instead of jumping right into editing and proofreading study, I faced my fears and decided to do something for my art in the remaining days of the month even if I still didn't have a consistent flow of income. I decided to write an entry for the Ateneo National Writers' Workshop 20, which I sent on the last day of the month. After some deliberation, I decided to focus on how walking helps me traverse the psycho-socio-religious liminality I am currently in.

In between these two major projects, I spent some time performing a metalearning project to look for the best resources and create a customized curriculum for improving my editing and proofreading skills. I also did two batches of overviews for Boobkright. Lea and I also went to a few adventures. We celebrated her birthday through a picnic lunch at Freedom Park. Then we went to Enchanted Kingdom where I faced my fears and explored emotions I never knew I had.

Throughout the month but particulary by the end, there were several occasions of bonding with our community. Benjie and Joji came to visit Los Baños and expressed desire to transfer here in the future. In addition, Lea and I went to Bal Bibal's Impression Workshop. We also attended the opening of Maui's solo exhibit, where I read my translation of A House Called Tomorrow by Alberto Rios and experienced flow while playing indigenous musical instruments. We then explored Elbi's hip-hop scene by watching Bevs' gig. Finally, we bonded with Kris Ann a couple of times.

After extending my runway, I was also able to open potential website design and development projects with Ili Likhaan and Candent. Meanwhile, I also started tapering my meds down to 1/4 tab per night and I was generally okay.
