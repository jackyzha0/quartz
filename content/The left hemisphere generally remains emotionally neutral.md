## The left hemisphere generally remains emotionally neutral  # 

[[The right hemisphere is responsible for emotional expression]], and [[the right hemisphere is capable of identifying emotional expression]]. But as for the [[left hemisphere]], though it is involved with emotion, it is by comparison with the [[Right hemisphere|right]], relatively emotionally neutral, something which is evidenced by its affinity for ‘non-emotional’, abstract paintings. Emotional stimuli are not incorporated into mood—not adopted personally—when offered to the [[left hemisphere]] rather than the [[Right hemisphere|right]]. The whole business seems more conscious, more willed, more deliberate, and that is in keeping with the [[left hemisphere]]'s need to influence and manipulate, as well as its role in re-presenting experience ([[The left hemisphere filters experience into an abstract representation, while the right sees things without preconceptions]]). In [[alexithymia]], a condition of lack of awareness or capacity to express emotional arousal in words, the problem arises from an inability of the emotionally aware [[right hemisphere]], which can be shown to be experiencing emotional arousal, to communicate it to the [[left hemisphere]].
