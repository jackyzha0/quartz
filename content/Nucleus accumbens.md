## Nucleus accumbens  #🧠 

The [[nucleus]] accumbens is an area in the [[brain]] involved in the cognitive processing of [[craving]], reward, and [[operant conditioning]], hence it also plays a significant role in [[addiction]]. The motivation for reward is experienced when the [[dopamine]] from the [[ventral tegmental area]] reaches the [[nucleus]] accumbens. The [[nucleus]] accumbens is also a “learning” pathway—learning what feels good. Upon consummation, those [[neuron]]s then release [[opioid peptide]]s, which generate the feeling of [[pleasure]] or bliss.
