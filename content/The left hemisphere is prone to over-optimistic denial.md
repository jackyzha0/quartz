## The left hemisphere is prone to over-optimistic denial # 

[[Those with damage to the right hemisphere lack insight into illness or even denial of it]], and [[those with right hemisphere legions show a dull unrelenting cheerfulness in the face of incapacity]]. Denial is a [[left hemisphere]] specialty: in states of relative [[right hemisphere]] inactivation, in which there is therefore a bias toward the [[left hemisphere]], subjects tend to evaluate themselves optimistically, view pictures more positively, and are more apt to stick to their existing point of view. In the presence of a [[right hemisphere]] stroke, the [[left hemisphere]] is ‘crippled by naively optimistic forecasting of outcomes’. It is always a winner: winning is associated with activation of the left [[amygdala]], losing with right [[amygdala]] activation.
