De quodam Modo Meditationis  
(Of a Certain Means of Meditation)

191

OW for the Chief of that which was granted unto  
me, it was the Apprehension of those willed  
Changes or Transmutations of the Mind which  
lead into Truth, being as Ladders unto Heaven, or so I called  
them at that Time, seeking for a Phrase to admonish the  
Scribe that attended on my Words, to grave a Balustre upon  
the Stele of of my Working. But I make Effort in vain, o my  
Son, to record this matter in Detail; for it is the quality of the  
Grass to quicken the Operation of Thought it may be  
Thousandfold, and moreover to figure each Step in Images  
complex and overpowering in Beauty, so that one hath no  
Time wherein to conceive, much less to utter, any Word for  
a Name or any of them. Also, such was the multiplicity of  
these Ladders, and their Equivalence, that the Memory  
holdeth no more any one of them, but only a certain  
Comprehension of the Method, wordless by Reason of its  
Subtilty. Now therefore must I make by my Will a Concen-tration mighty and terrible of my Thought, that I may bring  
forth this Mystery in Expression. For this Method is of  
Virtue and Profit, by it mayst thou come easily and with  
Delight to the Perfection of Truth, it is no Odds from what  
Thought thou makest the first Leap in thy Meditation, so hat  
thou mayst know how every Road endeth in Monsalvat, and  
the Temple of the Sangraal.

BELIEVE generally, on Ground both of Theory and  
Experience, so little as I have, that a Man must  
first be initiate, and established in Our Law, before  
he may use this Method. For in it is an Implication of our  
Secret Enlightenment, concerning the Universe, how its  
Nature is utterly Perfection. Now every Thought is a Separ-ation, and he Medicine of that is to marry Each One with its  
Contradiction, as I have shewed formerly in many Writings.  
And thou shalt clap the one to the other with Vehemence of  
Spirit, swiftly as Light itself, that the Ecstasy be spontaneous.  
So therefore it is Expedient that thou have ravelled already  
in this Path of Antithesis, knowing perfectly the Answer to  
every Griph or Problem, and thy Mind ready therewith. For  
by the Property of this Grass all passeth with Speed  
incalculable of Wit, and an Hesitation should confound thee,  
breaking down thy ladder, and throwing back thy Mind to  
receive Impression from Environment, as at hy first  
beginning. Verily; the nature of this Method is Solution, and  
the Destruction of every Complexity by Explosion of Ecstasy,  
as every Element thereof is fulfilled by its Correlative, and is  
annihilated (since it loseth separate Existence) in the  
Orgasm that is consummated within the Bed of thy Mind.

HOU knowest right well, o my Son, how a Thought  
is imperfect in two Dimensions, being separate  
from its Contradiction, but also constrained in its  
Scope, because by that Contradiction we do not (commonly)  
complete the Universe, save only that of its Discourse. Thus  
if we contrast health with Sickness, we include in their  
Sphere of Union no more than one Quality that may be  
predicated of all Things. Furthermore, it is for the most Part  
not easy to find or to formulate the true Contradiction of any  
Thought as a positive Idea, but only as a Formal Negation in  
vague Terms, so that he ready Answer is but the Antithesis.  
Thus to ìWhiteî one putteth not the Phrase ìall that which  
is not white,î for this is void, formless, neither clear, simple,  
nor positive in conception; but one answereth ìBlack,î for  
this hath an Image of his Significance. So the Cohesion of  
Antitheticals destroyeth them only in Part, and one  
becometh instantly conscious of the Residue that is unsatis-fied or unbalanced, whose Eidolon leapeth in thy Mind with  
Splendour and Joy unspeakable. Let not this deceive thee,  
for its Existence proveth its Imperfection, and thou must call  
forth its Mate, and destroy them by Love, as with the former.  
This Method is continuous and proceedeth ever from the  
Gross to the Fine, and from the Particular to the General,  
dissolving all Things into the One Substance of Light.

(Conclusion concerning this Method of Holiness)

194

EARN now that Impression of Sense have Oppo-sites readily conceived, as long to short, or light to  
dark; and so with Emotions and Perceptions, as  
Love to Hate, or false to true; but the more violent is the  
Antagonism, the more is it bound in Illusion, determined by  
Relation. Thus the Word ìLongî hath no Meaning save it be  
referred to a Standard; but Love is not thus obscure, because  
Hate is its Twin, partaking bountifully of a Common Nature  
therewith. Now, hear this; it was given unto me in my  
Visions of the ?thyrs, when I was in he Wilderness of  
Sahara, by Tolga, that above the Abyss, contradiction is  
Unity, and that Nothing could be true save by Virtue of the  
Contradiction that is contained in itself. Behold, therefore,  
in this method thou shalt come presently to Ideas of this  
Order, that include in themselves their own Contradiction,  
and have no Antithesis. Here then is thy Lever of Antinomy  
broken in thine Hand; yet, being in true Balance, thou mayst  
soar, passionate and eager, from Heaven to Heaven, by the  
Expansion of thine Idea, and its Exaltation, of Concentration  
as thou understandest by thy Studies in The Book of the  
Law, the Word thereof concerning Our Lady Nuith and  
Hadith that is the Core of every Star. And this last Going  
upon thy Ladder is easy, if thou be truly Initiate, for the  
Momentum of thy Force in Transcendental Antithesis  
serveth to propel thee, and the Emancipation from the  
Fetters of Thought hat thou hast won in that Praxis of Art  
maketh the Whirlpool and Gravitation of Truth of  
Competence to Draw theeunto itself.
