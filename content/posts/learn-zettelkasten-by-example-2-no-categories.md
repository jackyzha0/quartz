## Intro Blurb
In this post, I [[posts/simplest-way-to-use-zettelkasten-for-note-management|write fleeting notes]] on an article titled "Why Categories for Your Note Archive are a Bad Idea". The article is about why categories are limited and how Zettelkasten is better because it's more in line with how we think. Hopefully, this process can give you ideas about how to improve your Zettelkasten workflow. Also, feel free to suggest articles you want me to read next week.

## My Notes
**Article Link:** https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/

- Current organization techniques require you to make many decisions which add lots of friction to note-taking [[notes/too many decisions cause inaction|too many decisions cause inaction]]
- fleshing out categories is like setting up a routine. [[notes/routines are a shortcut to decision making|routines are a shortcut to decision making]]
- Organizing by categories is [[notes/organization with the tree structure|organization with the tree structure]]
- With [[notes/organization with the tree structure|organization with the tree structure]], new notes that don't fit the structure either cause compromise in organization or modification to the structure
- [[notes/the brain has an organic structure|the brain has an organic structure]]
- it's difficult and time consuming to update rigid structures (e.g. [[notes/organization with the tree structure|organization with the tree structure]])
- [[notes/starting is always better than not doing anything|starting is always better than not doing anything]]
