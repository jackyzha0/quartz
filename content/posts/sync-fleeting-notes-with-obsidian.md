When we organize notes through connections, the [[notes/having more connections is better|more the better]]. Fleeting Notes is a separate network of notes outside of Obsidian. The goal of this plugin sync both these networks of notes into one! Below are step-by-step instructions on how to do this.

## Installation / Setup
1. Go to Settings > Community Plugin and turn off the "Safe mode". With this turned off, you can install the plugin to perform the sync.
