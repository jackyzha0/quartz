For many, an important part of taking quick notes is to be able to process those quick notes in the future. As of v0.2.2 of the "Fleeting Notes Sync" obsidian plugin, I've added a simple command to "Insert all unprocessed notes". 

This commands inserts a checklist of unprocessed notes as references. Once an item is checked, the note will be processed. Then, future command runs will produce a checklist without the processed note.

Here is a video of me processing Fleeting Notes:
