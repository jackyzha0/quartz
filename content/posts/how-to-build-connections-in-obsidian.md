So you've built a [[posts/simplest-obsidian-workflow-in-1-minute|fantastic note-taking workflow]] but now you have some questions about connections like:
- Why do I want to connect notes?
- When do I create links or notes?
- How do I title notes?

In the next minute, I'll answer all of these questions and provide a process for creating and connecting notes. This workflow is heavily inspired by the [[notes/Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] method.

## Why do I want to [[notes/connecting ideas is powerful|connect notes]]?
- It allows us to:
	- Reuse notes in different context
	- Resurface past content which reinforces learning
- To get the most out of these connections, you'll need to create [[notes/atomic things are self-contained|atomic]] notes. In other words, notes that are short and specific to a topic.

## Steps for building connections:
1. As you write, when specific concepts stand out to you, create a connection for it.
	1. A good rule to follow is if you think you'll need it in the future, then create the note.
2. Once you've identified you want to create that link, first search past links you've created and check if you've already created the link.
3. If no links exist, create that link. Then populate the link with details of the concept and create a descriptive and concise title. We want to avoid generic titles like `school` or `work`.
