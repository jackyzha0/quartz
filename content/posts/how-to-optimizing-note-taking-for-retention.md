It's often more valuable to retain knowledge rather than acquire new knowledge. But thanks to content overload from the internet, we're constantly bombarded with new information from various sources. It's [[notes/clutter slows us down|difficult]] for us to retain knowledge when we're constantly acquiring new knowledge.

The solution to this problem is simple—regularly review past concepts. The issue many have with regular reviews is that it's cumbersome, hard to re-discover important/relevant information, and it's not [[notes/fun is a powerful motivator|fun]]. 

## How I Re-discover My Notes

As I write new notes, I would add *links* to concepts that I've created in the past. This linkage of ideas [[notes/connecting ideas improves learning|improves learning]] and introduces past concepts that are relevant. With this system, I've effectively made review a component of my note organization.
