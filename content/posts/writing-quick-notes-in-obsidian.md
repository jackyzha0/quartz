## Writing Quick Notes in Obsidian
When using Obsidian I know that [[notes/having more connections is better|having more connections is better]]. So I often take it upon myself to use Obsidian for everything. Thanks to the plugin system provided by Obsidian, it [[notes/the future is personalization|personalizes]] the way I use Obsidian and allowed me to do many things that would otherwise be impractical (e.g. getting my TODOs from Todoist). But even with this customizability, sometimes Obsidian just isn't the [[notes/use the right tool for the job|right tool for the job]]. One example is writing quick notes into Obsidian. 

When writing quick notes, I'm often in midst of something and I want to jot down something in the most frictionless way possible. With Obsidian, there's a lot of friction.

Points of Friction in Obsidian (Desktop):
- Switching windows to Obsidian
- Opening a new or existing note
- Renaming the title from "Untitled"
- Clicking into the note
- Typing the "quick" note
- Switching back to the original window

## Fleeting Notes x Obsidian
Although these points seem trivial, I've noticed that they add up and have prevented me from writing more notes or even any notes at all. Oftentimes I find that [[notes/opportunities are for the prepared|the best ideas come when I'm least prepared]] to write them down. Therefore I've decided to create an entire application called [Fleeting Notes](https://fleetingnotes.app/). As the name suggests, the app is solely dedicated to writing your fleeting thoughts. 

So how is "Fleeting Notes" better than Obsidian? It's not. 

[Fleeting Notes](https://fleetingnotes.app/) *enhances Obsidian.* It allows me to write quick notes (wth links + backlinks) within my browser and syncs seamlessly with Obsidian through a [[posts/sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|plugin]].
