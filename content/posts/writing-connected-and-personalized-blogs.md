So originally my blog was hosted on [https://thinkwong.com](https://thinkwong.com). It used WordPress which was good for typical blogging, but I wanted more than that. I wanted to demonstrate the effectiveness of connected notes and the best way to do that was to [[notes/lead by example|lead by example]]. Hence, I created a website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using a [digital garden template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template). And because [[notes/interoperable components are efficient|interoperable components are efficient]] I write less while providing more value.

Since content is condensed into atomic bits, I can create highly personalized blog posts that allow the reader to dive deeper into whichever idea they find interesting. Knowing that [[notes/time is the most valuable resource|time is the most valuable resource]], I can save both your time and mine! I believe [[notes/the future is personalization|the future is personalization]] and creating an interconnected system through Fleeting Notes is a way to achieve this.
