If what you do transcends the archetypes of its predecessors, then it can become something not explainable by them.

When quantum mechanics was formulated, people argued light cannot be both a wave and a particle at the same time. They were right, and wrong, it is neither. It is something that can’t be explained through the old frameworks of “waves” and “particles” because what light is transcends them both.

Cryptocurrencies are poised to potentially do the same, if we try to free ourselves from looking only through the lens of old archetypes. Centralized authority, vertically driven companies, trust, value, etc. can all be radically changed, which is the point of any revolutionary technology.
