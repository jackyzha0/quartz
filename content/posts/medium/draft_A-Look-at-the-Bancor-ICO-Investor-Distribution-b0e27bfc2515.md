What’s up folks? Welcome to another round of ICO analysis, this time we look at [Bancor](https://bancor.network/). They’re making a play at becoming the new standard for tokens. As per usual, I’m not commenting on platform legitimacy here, only the ICO model they use, its results, and their relation to trends in the entire ecosystem (the last part being my own personal views).

Starting out, I’d like to point out some previous posts about this subject that should be looked at. The amount of people doing analysis is far behind the amount of people attempting to build new things, so I appreciate finding and sharing the others attempting to shed light on what we’ve done. Here’s a that I pulled from for this article:

Also, I interviewed Taylor from [MyEtherWallet](https://medium.com/u/a9af0d538df5) on The Bitcoin Podcast about trends in the space, problems with ICOs, and what we can do. Check it out:
