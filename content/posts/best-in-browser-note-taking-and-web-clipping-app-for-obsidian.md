I've done a [[posts/best-web-clipper-for-obsidian|speal on webclipping]] in the past, but some feedback has made me realize that simply [copying the URL is not webclipping](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/v9mags/comment/ibzgkq6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). For Fleeting Notes to truly become a web clipper, it needed a way to capture raw content from the web. Which is why I've added highlights into Fleeting Notes. With this feature, you can now easily capture highlights and the source URL directly into Fleeting Notes. 

Additionally, I've gotten many requests from people to add a way to keep Fleeting Notes opened persistently. For many, note-taking and reading happens side-by-side. This is why I've also added a feature to open a persistent window for the Fleeting Notes app. This window can be resized to whatever fits your personal needs!

On a side note, you can follow this link to learn [[posts/sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|how to sync your fleeting notes to Obsidian]]

For users of Fleeting Notes and non-users. I'd love to know if you didn't really need this or if you'll be using this ASAP!
