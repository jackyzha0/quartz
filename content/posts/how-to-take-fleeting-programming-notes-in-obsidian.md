While programming, I often spend a lot of time searching for things that I already know. Which is why taking programming notes can be so useful. It creates a personalized "cache" of notes. But how do I create meaningful programming notes that I can always go back to? Well stay here to find out!

To create programming notes, I always start off with a title. I typically start with "how to" and end with "in {insert relevant language / framework}". This title succinctly explains the solution to the problem and makes searching easy. For example: "How to center a div in javascript". 

Then I create step-by-step instructions on how to solve the particular "how to". While writing, I keep things as dumb as possible because I know my future self will have no idea what I'm writing about. Typically I:
- Add code snippets when relevant 
- Use numbered steps so i can easily scan the answer
- Include the source to where i found the solution

For more complicated notes, I take advantage of linking notes. With linking, I reduce the amount I need to write in the note by expanding on the context in another note. The powerful thing about this is that I can [[notes/interoperable components are efficient|reuse my notes]] just like how I reuse functions while coding! 

So where does Obsidian come into this? Well with the Fleeting Notes app, notes can be [[posts/sync-fleeting-notes-with-obsidian|synced with Obsidian]] through the FN plugin. This way all notes taken within the Fleeting Notes will be automatically transferred into Obsidian!
