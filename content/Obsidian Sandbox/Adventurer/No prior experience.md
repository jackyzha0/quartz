There are plenty of note-taking apps out there, so congratulations on finding Obsidian! You may have heard that Obsidian is really hard to use, but we assure you 

There’s no silver bullet solution that works perfectly for everyone. Obsidian works best if you care about what we care about.

Do you have any of the following concerns below?

→ [[Vault is just a local folder|I don’t want my notes to been seen by others]]

→ [[Vault is just a local folder|I don’t want my notes to be inaccessible someday]]

→ [[Plugins make Obsidian special for you|I have special needs that most note-taking apps might not meet]]

→ [[Get started with Obsidian|Just let me get started already]]
