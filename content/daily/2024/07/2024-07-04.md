-   <https://github.com/mattwparas/steel>
    -   scheme in rust, found it because apparently it's (going to be) used for the
        plugin system in helix?
    -   Might be neat as a scripting tool since I have rust on all my computers
-   So I got quotebacks dark/light mode based on quartz's state working. I had to
    futz around with the javascript, but I think quotebacks is largely abandoned
    in the sense it won't be getting updates, so it's probably not a big deal to
    edit it.
    -   I also added it in under ofm.tsx, basically an option under mermaid. I'm not
        technically using obsidian but it seemed like the easiest place to jab in
        some javascript.
-   I need to fix dates. Maybe have ox-hugo just spit it out in the frontmatter.
