    -   Apparently GPTel supports the 'awesome gpt prompts' by reading in the csv?
        Just making a future note of this, might be something neat for my own projects.

    -   ellama, similar to GPTel.

## Journal {#journal}

Taking some time tinkering with Vapoursynth, I needed to get it working for my
mpv config. Trial run of some LLM models in emacs, think the lower parameter

I did not do half of this I got really into figuring out the accursed CSS changes.
