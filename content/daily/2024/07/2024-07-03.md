## Journal {#journal}

I forgot to (fully) review Chinese, so uh, there goes most of my day. Was
tinkering around with the programming language crystal for funsies. Next, I'd
like to try out gleam.

Going to try moving some files around to see if that fits
a flow of writing better? - I basically made a master list like 'movies' with
each movie as a subheader. Might get a little bit clustery with large files but
I don't really use images so I don't think it hurts.
