## Corpus callosum #🧠 

The corpus callosum is the part of the [[brain]] which connects the [[left hemisphere|left]] and [[right hemisphere]]s. It contains an estimated 300–800 million fibers connecting topologically similar areas in either hemisphere. Yet only 2 per cent of cortical [[neuron]]s are connected by this tract. What is more, the main purpose of a large number of these connections is actually to inhibit—in other words to stop the other hemisphere interfering. Although the majority of cells projecting to the corpus callosum use the facilitatory [[neurotransmitter]] [[glutamate]], and are excitatory, there are significant populations of [[neuron]]s that use the neurotransmitter [[GABA]] whose function is inhibitory. The evidence is that the primary effect of callosal transmission is to produce functional inhibition. 

So much is this the case that a number of neuroscientists have proposed that the whole point of the corpus callosum is to allow one hemisphere to inhibit the other. Stimulation of [[neuron]]s in one hemisphere commonly results in an initial brief excitatory response, followed by a prolonged inhibitory arousal in the other, contralateral, hemisphere. Such inhibition can be widespread, and can be seen on imaging. Even the excitatory fibers often terminate on intermediary [[neuron]]s, or ‘inter[[neuron]]s’, whose function is inhibitory. The types of attention that the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s bear to the world are incompatible, thus the corpus callosum keeps them from interfering with each other.
