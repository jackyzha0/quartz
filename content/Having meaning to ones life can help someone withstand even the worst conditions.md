## Having meaning to ones life can help someone withstand even the worst conditions # 

[[Viktor Frankl]] had claimed that here is nothing in the world that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one’s life. There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche: “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” He can see in these words a motto which holds true for any [[psychotherapy]]. In the Nazi concentration camps, which Frankl previously found himself in, he believes one could have witnessed that those who knew that there was a task waiting for them to fulfill were most apt to survive.
