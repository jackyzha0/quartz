## Economic competition  # 

In economics, competition is a secario where different economic firms are in contention to obtain goods that are limited by varying the elements of price, product, promotion and place. In classical economic thought, competition causes commercial firms to develop new products, services and technologies, which would give consumers greater selection and better products. The greater the selection of a good is in the market, the lower prices for the products typically are, compared to what the price would be if there was no competition ([[monopoly]]) or little competition ([[oligopoly]]).
