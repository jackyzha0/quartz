I still find it mysterious how someone could write such imagery. I know it is all metaphors, descriptions that liken one phenomena with another. But I feel like the poet steps into a different realm to see these images and to do so, he needs silence.

[[contacts/rem tanauan]] is perhaps right. You wouldn't find the words unless you are in that right state of mind. And it is difficult no to be kind when in that state of mind because you are seeing clearly, trying to commune, listen, pay attention, befriend, fall in love with that thing you are writing about. How can you not be good when you are in love?

To be in a constant poetic frame of mind is to be a constant beam of light.
