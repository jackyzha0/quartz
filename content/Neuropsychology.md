 ## Neuropsychology

Neuropsychology is a branch of psychology concerned with how a person's cognition and behavior are related to the [[brain]] and the rest of the [[nervous system]].

- [[Right hemisphere deficits result in difficulty with perceiving irregular smoothly curved surfaces]]
- [[The left hemisphere tends to be stubbornly certain, whereas the right acknowledges ambiguity and is always uncertain]]
- [[The left hemisphere of split-brain subjects has been shown to have to come up with random reasons for things the right hemisphere does]]
- [[The left hemisphere will confabulate explanations for things it doesn't know and seems completely convinced of them]]
- [[When guessing a sequence, the left hemisphere will choose a strategy even at the expense of getting things wrong]]

- [[The right hemispheres tendency for melancholy may be linked to its heightened capacity for empathy]]
- [[Moral values are dependent on right hemisphere intuition and empathy, rather than left hemisphere abstract reasoning]]
- [[Those with impairments in the right frontolimbic regions have trouble with stopping whatever they're currently doing]]
- [[The frontal lobes for each hemisphere only negate the posterior regions rather than resist, enabling something new to arise]]
- [[The right frontal lobes enables one to step back form espousing ‘my’ position, which enables us to empathize and consider the others point of view]]
- [[The left frontal lobe enables one to peacefully detach from the striving towards individual gain]]
- [[The right hemisphere may have more control over the SNS, and the left may have more control over the PNS]]

- [[An organism will feel less stressed if they believe they have control over a situation]]
- [[Predictable information may lower our stress-response while we are experiencing the stressor by letting us know what coping stratagies are best to use]]
- [[Organisms feel less stressed when they can control the rewards they can get than when those rewards are given to them for nothing]]
- [[Organisms feel a loss of control when faced with an novel and unpredictable situation]]
- [[The left hemisphere inhibits the right more than the right inhibits the left]]
- [[Instilling fear is a common marketing strategy because it quites the prefontal cortex and encourages impusivity]]
- [[Stress-related disease among the poor usually has more to do with feeling poor than actually being poor]]
- [[Income inequality is a strong predictor of poor health because it is about being made to feel poor]]
- [[Income inequality does not predict poor health as much in more egalitarian countries]]
- [[There is a steep rise in health from very poor to lower middle class, but it flattens out in the upper SES range]]
- [[Societies with more income equality, both the poor and the wealthy are healthier than their counterparts in a less equal society with the same average income]]
- [[The low social capital that comes with income inequality can lead to more stress and poor health]]
- [[Dramatic income inequality gets rid of the possibility for there to be lots of social capital in a society, leading to more stress and poor health]]
- [[More social capital in a society can improve the health of the society]]
- [[More income inequality means that the wealthy will spend more money on their own private goods, leading to more stress among the public]]
- [[To really address the poor health of the poor, we would have to uproot the stressors involved in low rank rather than give people more money]]
- [[Unlike monkey's, humans who rank low in the hierarchy almost always have a disproportionate share of disease]]
- [[Receiving a reward at an unpredictable time interval creates a stronger stress response than when it is received predictably]]

- [[Having social support is shown to lower the stress-response in humans]]
- [[Our brains make us-them distinctions extremely quickly]]
- [[People have an enhanced capacity for empathy towards in-group members]]
