## Expanded consciousness  # 

Expanded consciousness occurs with states such as [[the three wholesome roots]], gratefulness, or when being open to feelings, people and nature. This feeling is often accompanied by a diminution of [[ego]], as well as a falloff in the attention paid to past and future on which the [[ego]] feasts. [[People generally live ruminating the past or anticipating the future rather than enjoying the present moment]]. Expanded consciousness is correlated with a drop in activity the [[posterior cingulate cortex]] and increase of activity in the [[parasympathetic nervous system]]. It contrasts with [[contracted consciousness]].
