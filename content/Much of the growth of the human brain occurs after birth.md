## Much of the growth of the human brain occurs after birth #🧠 

To ensure that babies can make their way out of the birth canal, [[the evolution of the human brain lead to our brains being immature at birth]]. On the other hand, it will undergo tremendous growth outside the mother’s body. In the period following birth, the human [[brain]], unlike that of the chimpanzee, continues to grow at the same rate as in the womb. There are times in the first year of life when, every second, multiple millions of [[synapse|synaptic]] connections are established. Three-quarters of our [[brain]] growth takes place outside the womb, most of it in the early years. By three years of age, the [[brain]] has reached 90 percent of adult size, whereas the body is only 18 percent of adult size. 

This explosion in growth outside the womb gives us a far higher potential for learning and adaptability than is granted to other mammals. If we were born with our [[brain]] development rigidly predetermined by heredity (contra [[Gene expression is highly contingent on the environment]]), the [[frontal lobe]]s would be limited in their capacity to help us learn and adapt to the many different environments and social situations we humans now inhabit.

Greater reward demands greater risk. Outside the relatively safe environment of the womb, the developing brain is highly vulnerable to potentially adverse circumstances. [[Addiction]] and [[ADHD]] are the possible negative outcomes. Although, the [[brain]] can already be negatively affected in the [[uterus]] in ways that increase vulnerability to [[addiction]] and [[ADHD]].
