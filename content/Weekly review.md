A weekly review is one of the four kinds of [[Review]] necessary to maintain a functional [[thoughts/life management system]]. [[David Allen]] calls the weekly review the "Master Key to GTD” ([[getting things done]])—the most critical habit to maintain the system.

According to [[thoughts/tiago forte]], [[A weekly review is an operating system]], which is checked by a [[Monthly review]]. He further notes that, because [[Weekly habits are more difficult to build]], establishing and maintaining a Weekly Review habit can be difficult. Nevertheless, when properly designed, a weekly review can free up your mind and spur you to take action ([[A life management system should free your mind]]; [[Build a life management system that helps you take intentional action]]). For Tiago, a good Weekly Review should be done fast and lightly for about 15-30 minutes. To do so, the reviewer needs to resist the urge to actually do a task and focus on processing open loops.

Here is [[thoughts/my weekly review routine]].

TO DO

- This is still written in Tiago's perspective. Rewrite it to use my perspective.
