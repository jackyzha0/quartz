## Those who take their heaviest imprint on the Socio-Sexual Circuit tend to be very attractive  # 

Persons who take their heaviest [[imprint]] on the [[Socio-Sexual Circuit]] are beautiful. That is, their entire body has received so much [[oxytocin]] from the [[brain]] that they are constantly radiating the “attractive” mating signals that make up our perception of what is “beautiful” in a human being. According to accidents of [[imprint]]ing, they can be coldly calculating exploiters, totally repressed Puritans or carry some other negative traits but they always look like (send the signals of) the ideal fucker-lover-protector.
