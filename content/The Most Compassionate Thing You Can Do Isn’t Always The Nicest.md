### Annotations

- Idiot compassion is when you do what appears to be the nicest or kindest thing, instead of doing what actually needs to be done and what would be the most beneficial.

- compassion takes a lot of courage. In today’s world, it takes a lot of courage to speak up in the face of being disowned, disliked, and canceled. It takes tremendous courage to pick yourself up and do what you know is right in the face of an infinite number of distractions, immediate pleasures, and endless easy routes out.

- If you only understand compassion as a soft and passive quality, you may decide it’s not worth it. You may decide to just take it easier on yourself, to lower your expectations to the ground, to quit being so righteous, and to give in to the desire for comfort and security and approval from others.

- But as you can figure, this is often extremely far from the most compassionate thing you can do for yourself, and for the rest of us. If idiot compassion is believing the nicest and kindest thing to do is always the right thing, wise compassion is understanding that the right thing to do is often not the nicest or easiest or most pleasant thing. And having the courage to do it anyway.
