## Our enviroment consists of the time-binding product of materialized ideas  # 

If you are not alone in the wilderness, lift your eyes and look about. All that you see, whoever theoretically “owns” it, is the [[time-binding]] product of the materialized or manifested ideas of creative men and women. It is all [[negentropy]]. Coherent order. And it is moving toward higher and more coherent order at a faster rate-of-change all the time. Of course, if you are alone in the wilderness, you will also see coherent order, but in this case, the rate-of-change toward higher order is much slower. That is, those [[stochastic process]]es which we call [[gene]]tic drift, evolution etc. are co-selecting higher order at a different time rate than those stochastic processes which we call human thought, invention, culture etc. 

This is why it is so hard to reach agreement about whether the natural processes are intelligent or not. If we accept any ordering process as intelligent, then the biosphere is indeed intelligent; but if we save the word “intelligence” only for those [[stochastic process]]es that move at the same speed as our [[brain]]s, then Nature is merely mechanical, not intelligent. To an extra-terrestrial with a different time-sense than ours, this question would not arise at all. Most of what we perceive in the human environment is made up of concretized ideas, in the above sense. Look again at a human community; you are seeing the historical human mind manifesting itself.
