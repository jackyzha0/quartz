## Summary

The main areas I nurtured this month were sustaining and connecting. I did a new set of OVIC overviews and got paid for the trial run I did last month. I also landed a research ghostwriting gig, which Claire referred to me, and which I landed through an awesome cover letter, a decent enough discovery call, and an excellent writing test. Landing this job boosted my confidence. It was my first real win throughout this job search process, and with that it was already worth-it by itself. Doing the work also gave me a refresher on research writing, which will help me when I focus on editing academic writing. These two gigs gave me some sense of security and convinced me to use the free time I generated to focus on achieving consistency of income through freelance editing and writing. While looking for gigs, I also spent a considerable amount of time just brainstorming the ideal business setup I want. I read The Free Agent Ecosystem by Tiago Forte, which introduced me to some really important principles I plan to incorporate in my freelancing.

In terms of connecting, I spent time bonding with Camille and my cousins, realizing that in a few months, my relationships with my cousins will definitely change as they transition into marriage life. I also made my intention to establish a daily connecting practice through a personal CRM app. I discovered Clay and this moved me to reach out to people like Kleinifer Palma. This led to an unexpected reunion at Baguio with her and Gerald Bandonil. I also started chatting with Lovelle Almazar, a fellow editor in the Philippines. Also, I spent a simple birthday celebration with Lea, who gifted me with a hand and foot massage package. Speaking of massages, I had two body massages this month, something I wanted to do but never had since 2017 (?).

In other areas, it is still slow in the understanding department. I did enjoy reading Wilderness and the Heart, specifically the article: "Answering the Call of the Wild: Walking with Bugbee and Thoreau" by Daniel W. Conway and Things I Like About Christianity by Steve Patterson. I also wrote three poems and had a few walks.

## Studies

While working on an OVIC overview about the police abolition movement, I was reminded of anarchy and its belief on what is possible. It touched something within me, something that asks me, am I living based on what my heart knows is possible or have I given up and accepted the status quo?

I wrote:
- [[Over-attachment to an identity encourages close-mindedness]]
- [[Breathing and acting are similar]]
- [[Remembering the past is important]]

## Writing
- I wrote poems:
	- [[poems/diyad perya]] and its translation into Filipino
	- [[ang unang liwayway]]
	- [[poems/tunog]]

## Photography

## Walking
- Walked from Matic-Matic to Cablong and gathered thoughts about simple living.
- [[2023-02-12]]: I walked to Forestry via Grove. There were so many people that the walk was suboptimal. Things got better when I was reaching Forestry, particularly when I started hearing the birds and the insect sounds. While there, I realized  how important Nature is for my spirituality and well-being, but also that I am not spending enough time in it.

## Projects
