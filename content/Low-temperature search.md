## Low-temperature search  # 

In machine learning and AI, a low-temperature search involves reaching for the most probable or nearest-to-hand answer, like the one that worked for a similar problem in the past, and requires less energy (contra [[high-temperature search]]). Low-temperature searches succeed more often than not.
