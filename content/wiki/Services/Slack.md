We use Slack for internal communication and watercooler chitchat among VAULT team members in the USA.
Aside from channels like 'General', 'Editors', 'Motion', 'Producers' and 'Remote Tips & Help'; we have other not work related chats (Quarantine Cooking, Things to watch, etc), feel free to peak inside and join the ones you like.

For work related conversation, please use Microsoft Teams.
