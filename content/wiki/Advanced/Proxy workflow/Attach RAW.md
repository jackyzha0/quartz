Step 1 – Select desired files , right click, and select “Proxy” -> “Reconnect Full Resolution Media...”

Step 2 – Select the first file of footage list. Click “Attach.”

Step 3 – Use the the “Search” button or search manually to find the corresponding RAW footage. Click “Okay” once selected. It should connect to all footage. If some remain unlinked, re-do this step with those files.
