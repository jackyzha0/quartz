File Name: The proxy file names should include the raw file name with “_proxy” added to end. This helps to easily link the files.

Location: Set the output to the “_proxies” folder.  
Format & Preset – Use QuickTime to create “Apple ProRes 422 Proxy.” Select

“Match Source” to automatically set the below settings:

Pixel [[wiki/Definitions/Frame sizes|Frame sizes]] // Width & Height – This ratio should match the raw, but as a lower resolution. For example: 3840 x 2160 is a 16:9 ratio. Set the proxy to a lower resolution while maintaining the 16:9 ratio, like 1920 x 1080. Note: The resolution is usually locked within it’s ratio. Click the checkbox and/or chain icon to unlock.

Frame Rate – Match the raw footage – see source info. Field Order — Set to “Progressive,” if it isn’t set automatically.

Pixel Aspect – Match the raw footage. Default to square (1:1) unless the footage is anamorphic, which is 2.0 (2.1).
