## Cognitive distortion  # 

In [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], a cognitive distortion is an exaggerated or irrational thought pattern involved in the onset or perpetuation of psycho-pathological states, such as [[depression]] and [[anxiety]]. Cognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality "inaccurately." According to [[Aaron Beck]]'s cognitive model, a negative outlook on reality is a factor in symptoms of emotional dysfunction and poorer subjective well-being. Specifically, negative thinking patterns reinforce negative emotions and thoughts. Some refute this to always be the case (see [[depressive realism]]).
