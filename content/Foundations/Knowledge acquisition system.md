title: Knowledge acquisition system
---

I see the ability to **acquire knowledge quickly** as one of the most important, especially in the face of a very fast-changing world. As such, it is a skill that can simply be developed.

For example, I see from myself that my memory has become incomparably better over the past few years. I could be wrong but I assume they have an effect on this:

- reading [[Knowledge/Books/Books]]
- listening to i.e.:  [[Knowledge/Podcasts/Huberman Lab]]
- taking care of [[Foundations/Process#The foundation]] (for example, about sleep and rest)
- much less stress

## How do I learn new topics?
It's a process based on **surrounding myself with a chosen topic** based on the **best available sources**, which I choose carefully. I believe they define how effectively I learn.

Sources are usually centered around people or projects. There are also people around them who are worth watching. We can say that it is a network of connections that allows us to reach out to more sources and thus shape our entire environment.

[[Knowledge/Books/Books]] are another part of the knowledge acquisition process. The key is just to choose the right titles. The aforementioned sources help with this.

**Basically:** 
- Reading a book is in a way, like a conversation with an author
- I treat the whole process as fun and having a good time
- I accept everything I find with openness and detachment
	- openness: I assume that the information is true and valuable
	- distance: I don't trust her 100% and assume she may be misleading me
	- A combination of openness and detachment offers the opportunity to develop **better** practices than those recommended by the best
- I reach out to the best possible sources (blogs, articles, youtube channels, twitter accounts, online courses)
- I get to know people who are at the root of a topic (such as technology developers or prominent experts). I usually do this on Twitter or Instagram
- I discover titles of recommended books and those that intrigue me
- I subscribe to the newsletters of the above-mentioned people

## How much am I study?
I don't measure it in any way, but learning is practically an integral part of my day. This means that I use practically every free moment to learn something new. At the same time, I also have space for total non-thinking, rest and silence, which I also see as a very important part of the process of acquiring knowledge.

## Detailed process
Na [[Projects/Ahoy!]] I described the detailed process of how I learn (polish only):
