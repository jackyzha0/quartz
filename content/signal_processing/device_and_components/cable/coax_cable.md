A coaxial cable as a transmission line consisting of an inner conducting wire of radius A and an outer conducting sheath of radius B. The space between the two conductors is filled with a dielectric. The fields are entirely contained internally, so coaxial cables are completely protected from outside interference. However, they are difficult to fabricate, [unbalanced](signal_processing/device_and_components/cable/coax_cable_imbalance.md) and lossy over long distances, so their use is constrained to close range applications.
