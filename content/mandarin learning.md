## Intro

  

It's a common goal of mine to be able to understand Chinese mainland mandarin and navigate or sustain day to day talk in a roughly competent manner.

My interest in Chinese goes way back to my childhood. The symbols (ideograms), martial arts and overall cultural aspects instilled in me a fascination of it's own kind. Now, heading into this journey.

Below some online resources to aid you, if you are interested in getting used to this language:

* **Dictionaries**

	- [Zhongwen (Google Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zhongwen-chinese-english/kkmlkkjojmombglmlpbpapmhcaljjkde)
	  One of my most used dictionaries. Definitely give it a try. Check the How-to's [here](https://zhongwen-chrome.blogspot.com/) and start leveraging its power today!
	
	- [Dict.cn](https://dict.cn/)
	  A very handy online dictionary to translate chinese words. I made a common use this way, for example: ```http://dict.cn/老师```
	  Cool if you are using a sheet for "flashcarding" new learning words. It gets easier to automate a link for lookups doing this.
	
	- [Baidu Fanyi (翻译)](https://fanyi.baidu.com/)
	  Complete translation tool from many dialects of mandarin into other languages. More trustworthy than Google Translation in this regard, made for natives of asian speaking languages. Also has a very useful mobile app, check it out!
	
	- [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/)
	  One of the most famous world dictionaries for mobile devices. If you are investing into learning mandarin and don't know where to start, give Pleco a try. With its paid features on, makes it a one-stop-shop for mandarin students.

* **Vocabulary**
	
	- [Skritter](https://skritter.com/demo)
	  Skritter is a powerful aid for learning character writing both for Chinese mandarin or Japanese kanji.
	
	- [Mandarin Bean](https://mandarinbean.com/new-hsk-vocabulary/)
	  Despite all the other resources who will aid you in gaining vocabulary, sometimes you need a compreehensible list. It's made for you! Very handy to print and put at your desk for offline reference. There's also a whole lot of resources like tests etc. Enjoy!
	
	- [Chinese HSK Consolidated](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-BppwKJzK1swKgGw94jTB0GGB2vfr8tPdh0sTW7wi9Y/edit?usp=sharing)
	  I've found this in 2021 without even grasping how mandarin worked out or how to tackle its study. Turns out it's very handy for checking words and frequency order for all HSKs levels!
