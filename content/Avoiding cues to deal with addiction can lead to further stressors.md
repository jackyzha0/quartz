## Avoiding cues to deal with addiction can lead to further stressors  # 

Avoiding [[operant conditioning]] cues might help prevent people from being triggered, but does not directly target the core [[habit]] loop. For example, staying away from friends who smoke can be helpful. Yet if getting yelled at by the boss triggered someone to smoke, avoiding the boss might lead to other [[stressor]]s, such as unemployment. This is one reason why traditional methods of behavior change usually fail.
