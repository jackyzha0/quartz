Simplicity can be used to tackle complexity. Because the structure is simple, content can be complex.

In note-writing systems like [[Zettelkasten]] and [[Talahardin]], we only follow a handful of principles ([[Luhmann's Zettelkasten Manual]]). But these are enough to allow the growth of a large body of personal kowledge.

## To do

- Literature note. Cultivate it to become a permanent note.
