↖️ [[Letters with Jason]]

In 1988 I was an exchange student in Denmark. During my 12 months away I would have written and received over 150 letters in each direction, each penned by hand. Phone calls were expensive and had to be scheduled by letter in advance to cover off on the different timezone between Australia and Denmark.

Since then, the only letters I have written involve business transactions in some way.

Throughout June 2023 Jason Becker and I wrote eight letters back-and-forth between us (four each). These are my reflections on that experience.

Our letters were via email and we constrained ourselves to one each per week. The artificial timing matched the timing we would have expected if we lived in the same town instead of on opposite sites of the planet. I found that I wanted to rush the conversation forward faster, compounded partially by following Jason's blog and Mastodon posts. Email gave me the means which I ignored.

There was something more than time involved in my desire to push forward. Our conversation felt like it was stuttering and couldn't get traction. To write a letter of meaningful length prevented the one line question or clarification that would occur in a face-to-face conversation. The conversation was transmit-receive-transmit rather than the dance of conversation we spoke of in [[Letters - W1]] and [[Letters - W2]].

Beyond that initial exploration of why conversation was important to us and our participation in the exercise, I deliberately chose to stay out of the meta conversation about the letter writing and let that happen.

Now that we are done, will we write again? Possibly, but not in the same week about format. I'm conscious of Jason's time and him giving it to the next person who wants to participate. This is one area where social media and forums work well. People are able to drop in and out of conversations as it suits them. So, I'll keep in touch with Jason by commenting on Mastodon.

Another byproduct of the week about writing was a block on topics going to their natural conclusion. I felt there was more to say on some topics, and more to listen to, yet I felt compelled to add something else to get the value of my digital postage. Most of our letters as you can see here are approximately the same number of paragraphs. Certainly for me that's the length of conversation where I started to feel uncomfortable not having immediate feedback.

I'm glad I put my hand up to play as pen pals for a while. It was nice getting to know Jason better and to have an opportunity to explore some of my thinking.
