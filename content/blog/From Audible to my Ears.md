This is the process each audiobook transitions through on the way from Audible to my listening ears.

1. Purchase more books on [Audible](https://www.audible.com.au/) than I possibly have time to listen to.
2. Download and convert to .mdb format using [OpenAudible](https://openaudible.org/).
3. Automatically import into my "Audiobook" library (as Music) using [Plex](https://plex.tv). Add to a series playlist if relevant.
4. Download to my iPhone using [Prologue](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prologue/id1459223267).
5. Mark as reading in Goodreads - if I’ve already read the book, apply to the book record and add to “Read and Listen” shelf. This keeps all readings of a book together.
6. Apply headphones to head, or sit in car with CarPlay.
