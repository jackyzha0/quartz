I regularly see posts in the _[Life of Dad Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/lifeofdad)_ that inadvertently suggest you’re not a _real dad_ unless you are always putting your family ahead of your own needs, and making large sacrifices for your family.

I know they are trying to be supportive.

I believe these kind of posts set unrealistic and unhealthy expectations. I feel it inside me when I read them.

I worry they discourage some fathers from seeking help when they need it because dads must be stoic and strong in the face of all odds.

Inside every dad is a human and all that entails.
