So this is interesting. I watched a video a week ago about "[How to Get Faster as a Sim Racing Beginner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxNjGgu2ohw&t=347s)”. One single comment stood out to me. Set the wheel degree of rotation in the PC control panel and then set Assetto Corsa Competizione's (ACC) setting to match. 

For this change to occur on the PC I lugged the stand with wheel and pedal all to the back room. Updated firmware while I was at it. Now there is a PS5/PS4 mode but no idea what the difference is, unless it's like PS3 mode. Some PS4 games on a PS5 may need it in PS4 mode.

Degree of rotation was 900. I set it to 720 as per video.

Jump into ACC. My wheel was set at 120 degrees for some reason. I think that's an error. Would have thought it was 270 or 540. Anyway, set to 720 to match. Also dropped a force feedback value thingy from 70 to 60 to match the video. I'd been playing earlier in the day so had a reference point.

Holy hit the apex Batman. Went from driving a tractor to light power steering. Super precise on the corners. Indy GP circuit had a couple of tricky corners in the past. No more.

Let's test this. Nurburgring corners 1-4 are a right PITA, especially 2 and 3. Always oversteering. Now a piece of cake.

Spa. There is a trophy to get around in under 2:25. I've seen people do it easily. I couldn't ever get below a high 2.28. Lap 3, low 2.27.

Learning from others is important to progress in may computer games. I’ve slowly been improving my sim-racing over time, yet nothing was as changing as learning to get the underlying configuration right. Sometimes what is obvious to us isn’t so on the face of things and we need to seek out, and be open to the experience of others. This is true of many areas of life.
