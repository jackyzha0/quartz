Suggested names to save time. Some are already in use which leads me to believe I’m onto something.

| Day       | Morning   | Afternoon | Evening     |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Today     | Tomorn    | Tonoon    | Tonight     |
| Yesterday | Last-morn | Last-noon | Last night  |
| Tomorrow  | Tommorn   | Tomnoon   | Tomnight    |
| Monday    | Momorn    | Monoon    | Monight     |
| Tuesday   | Tumorn    | Tunoon    | Tunight(†)  |
| Wednesday | Wemorn    | Wenoon    | Wenight     |
| Thursday  | Thmorn    | Thnoon    | Thnight     |
| Friday    | Frimorn   | Frinoon   | Frinight(‡) |
| Saturday  | Satmorn   | Satnoon   | Satnight    |
| Sunday    | Sumorn    | Sumorn    | Sunight     |

(†) Similar to Tonight. It's all in the inflection. 

(‡) Don’t confuse with the 1985 classic vampire move _[Fright Night](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089175/)_ or the gastronomic “Fry night”.

Examples:
* “Hey Julie. So glad it’s Frinoon. Do you want to go to the movies Tomnight?”
* “Last Thmorn I had coffee with my Dad.”

The major obstacle to this new nomenclature are today’s spell checkers. All will have to be reconfigured.
