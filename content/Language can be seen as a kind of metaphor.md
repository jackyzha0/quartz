## Language can be seen as a kind of metaphor  #🧠 

The discovery of the metaphoric nature of language as seen in [[the fifth stage of perception]] has its roots in the 19th century, and inspired [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]s famous dictum that "language is fossil poetry." Thus, to want something is to be empty—want and vacant come from the same root. Speaking of all desires as "appetites" brings us back to the same metaphor. A villain, as the Marxists have pointed out, is a person without property. Man is a general human being, as Feminists point out, because of the gender bias in our language. A humorous story of sexual nature is a "dirty joke" because ascetics and puritans have left there own programs embedded within modern speech; but Saxon words for bodily functions are "dirtier" than Norman words because of a plurality of puritan-economic prejudices.
