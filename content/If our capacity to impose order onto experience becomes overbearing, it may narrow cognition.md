## If our capacity to impose order onto experience becomes overbearing, it may narrow cognition # 

In general, the kind of precooked or conventionalized thinking produced by [[predictive coding]] usually serves us well. But only up to a point. We pay a price for the achievement of order and [[ego]] in the adult human mind. While suppressing uncertainty in the [[brain]] serves to promote realism, foresight, careful reflection and an ability to recognize and overcome wishful and paranoid fantasies, at the same time this achievement tends to constrain cognition and exert a limiting or narrowing influence on [[consciousness]], which may lead us too far into a [[low-entropy state]]. At it's extreme, it may lead us into [[Idolatry]].
