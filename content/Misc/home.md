Things which I didn't really have a category for.

## Definitions/glossaries
-  [[linux-isms|Linux-isms]]: A glossary of the linux terms I've used.
- [[what-is-a-garden|What is a Garden?]]: The definitions of "digital garden" that I like most.
- [[lsat|LSAT]]
## Others
- [[keys|Key Layouts]]: Sometimes, a good solution starts as a technical necessity.
