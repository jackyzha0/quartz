For as long as I can remember [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Intuition]] has played a key role in my life and since I realized this, I have been intentionally observing its presence and exploring all available materials on it.

Intuition, in its definition, is defined as the ability to make accurate decisions immediately and its foundation is based on our previous experiences. In other words: the more experience we have, the more likely our intuition is to be accurate.

Personally, I don't quite agree with this and prefer the term 'Unconscious Intelligence'. This is due to a simple fact: I have been making outstanding decisions from an early age and at that time there was no question of having experience or drawing information from my environment.

Interestingly, we can strengthen our access to intuition (e.g., by looking within ourselves) and weaken it (e.g., by giving in to social pressure).

At the end of the day, it's a 'Shine' that is sometimes hard to see and other times hard to follow, through lack of logical arguments.
