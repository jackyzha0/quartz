## Those who are not following their own unique course experience friction from being in conflict with the order of the Universe # 

[[Every individual has their own unique character and purpose by design of the universe]]. Anyone who is forced from their own course, either through not understanding themselves, or through external opposition, comes into conflict with the order of the Universe, and suffers accordingly. Some may think it their duty to act in a certain way, through having made a false ideal of themselves, instead of investigating their actual nature. A boy's instinct may tell him to go to sea, while his parents insist on him becoming a doctor. In such a case, he will be both unsuccessful and unhappy in medicine. If we put our heart into our own work and have done our best, we will feel elated; but what we have said or done otherwise shall give us no peace. It is a deliverance that does not deliver.
