- Uses existing cell and wifi infrastructure to find loction
- low cost, low power, high availability, works indoor and outdoor, 
- low accuracy
- 

**Methods**
- ID of current cell tower
	- GSM cell ID
	- some cell towers have sector-antennas which improves accuracy using [[angulation]]
- TDMA/FDMA
	- signals record timings for syncronization
	- these timings can be used to calculate distance
- Uplink time difference of arrival (UL-TOA)
	- many (4) stations with distance
	- use [[lateration]] to calculate position
