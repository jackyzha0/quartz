# Stage one
Dont know anything. cant learn independently. any activity is unbearable. lots of study and memorisation. trying to pass the  [[nope-threshold]].

# Stage two
capable of engaging with basic content. transition from 2-3 the epiphany moment: you realize that japanese isn't so difficult. 

# Stage three
immersion is enjoyable. learning is a byproduct. 

i dont (yet) need to get further than this.
