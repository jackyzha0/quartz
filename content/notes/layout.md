Techniques such as, [similarity](notes/law-of-similarity.md), [grouping](notes/grouping.md) and (to a lesser extent) [closure](notes/law-of-closure.md), can be used to organise and groupu our interfaces. Often the grouping and layout is done before the rest of the design.

Examples:

This is relatively easy. However, when done badly it can quickly confuse the user.

**Summary**
- alignment guides the eye and reduces clutter
- avoid slight misalignments that undermine your ability to beacon organisation
- we automatically notice patterns and deviations
- when you deviate do so strategically
- use visual proximity and scale to convey semantic information

# Jan Tschichold and Bauhaus
There was a sudden change from the right images to the left. This was partly due to advances in technology. This change was made by the Bauhaus group/school which became a way of thinking. Their ideas were inspired by architecture. The style was simple, functional, well grouped. These elements are also present in their visual design.
