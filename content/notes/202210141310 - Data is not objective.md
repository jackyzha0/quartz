Data is not objective. Although it may seem like a neutral representation of reality, the truth is that data is always obtained through some sort of instrument or technique that imposes a particular structure to the information we aim to study. Furthermore, we often transform data and use models to search for patterns, which can further shape our understanding of the information.  I like this [post on the topic by Carlos Gil Bellosta](https://www.datanalytics.com/2021/01/21/mas-sobre-el-mito-de-la-objetividad-especialmente-la-data-driven/)

While the concept of being data-driven can be appealing, it's important to remember that this approach does not necessarily uncover absolute truths or a complete understanding of how the world operates. Our flawed human brains act as lenses through which we view and interpret data, and our biases and limitations can affect the way we interpret information.

It's crucial to approach data analysis with a critical eye and an awareness of potential biases, limitations, and assumptions. Rather than assuming that data alone can provide a complete picture of reality, we must continually question and refine our understanding of the world through ongoing inquiry and exploration.
