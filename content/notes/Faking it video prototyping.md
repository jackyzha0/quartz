# Video prototyping

## 1 benefits
- cheap and fast
- great communication
- can serve as spec for devs
- ties interface design to tasks

## 2 fidelity
low-fi 2-5min brainstorm
mid-fi 1-4 paper prtotypes video
hi-fi slick +fancy for investors/management

## 3 shows
- like a storyboard, the whole tasks
	- motivvationa and success
- draw on tasks you've observed
- illustrate importand tasks
- help scope minimum viable poduct
- forces you to make design decisions in a new way

## 4 steps
- outline (maybe use storyboards)
- fin to extemporize
- equiment
	- a camera (not fancy needed)
	- people
	- realistic location
- focus on the message more than production values

## 5 considerations
- silent(with title cards) or with audio
	- audio can be finicky
- interface can be anything
	- mockups, paper prototypes, code
- can show success and failure of interfaces an failure
- edit as little as possible (time consuming)
