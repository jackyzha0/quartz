# Grammar
![](https://i.imgur.com/uB2CLf6.png)

sort of SOV e.g., I sushi eat. (english is SVO i eat sushi)

in english the order of words tells us who did what

in japanese sentences are made up of _particles_. each one indicates how the word before it relates to other words in the sentence, usually to the verb — which is usually last. the order of the words can vary because the particles tell us who did what not the word order

# Sound system
24 consonant sounds, 5 vowel sounds (english: 24 and 14)

language formed using either consonant vowel pair (except the "n" sound).

has pitch accent: distinguish similar spelled words. 

pitches follow rules:
- first and second mora have different pitches,
- cant return from low to high

# Writing system
intriduced from china in the 4th or 5th century. evolved into its own system. 

three types or writing
- **hiragana** (46 chars + 2 diacritical marks)
	- used to denote sounds, and for functional words and inflectional ending (also some content words)
	- each one symbolises with a vowel or a consonant combinied with a vowel.
- **katakana** a syllabary used or loan or onomaopoeic words and scientific words
- **kanji** (from china), used for meaning and sound traditionally
