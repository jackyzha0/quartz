### aws file transcription

TL;DR: Still not finished. This tells you how to take an audio file, upload it to AWS (assuming you've already created a bucket, either with something like `aws s3 mb recordings` or manually via the website), create a user account (they call it an "IAM User") with the necessary permissions, transcribe the file, and then manually submit a batch job to translate it. Translating via terminal/programmatically is a headache that I still haven't figured out. It involves temporary permissions (they call them "IAM Roles"), instead of just giving the user account permission. That's all that's remaining for this to be a complete tutorial to automate permissions.

Bonus! I also included a [[2023-07-26 GPT prompt]]

##### Create user to do transcriptions
Run the following commands in the cloud console (or on your machine which already has access to the AWS CLI. Since I didn't want to bother with downloading and configuring the CLI, I chose the cloud console). To access the console Go to `https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/users` -> and click on the console button, which looks like this: <a class="globalNav-0291 globalNav-029 globalNav-0210 _icon-color_izqbm_6" href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home?region=us-east-1" title="CloudShell" target="_self" rel="noreferrer noopener" id="awsc-nav-scallop-icon" data-testid="awsc-nav-scallop-icon" data-tools-experience-ingress-point="cloudshell-icon-header"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="2.0" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" class="globalNav-0216" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M5 5l2.997 2.998L5 11m4.997-.002H12m3-7.626A2.374 2.374 0 0012.627 1H3.37A2.372 2.372 0 001 3.372v9.256a2.373 2.373 0 002.37 2.373h9.257A2.375 2.375 0 0015 12.628V3.372z" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-miterlimit="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" fill="none"></path></svg></a>
1. `aws iam create-user --user-name TranscribeUser`
2. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess`
3. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonTranscribeFullAccess`
4. `aws iam create-access-key --user-name TranscribeUser` [^1]
5. `aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name TranscribeUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/TranslateFullAccess` (figured it out by running ~~```export POLICYARN=$(aws iam list-policies --query 'Policies[?PolicyName==`TranslateFullAccess`].{ARN:Arn}' --output text)```~~ `aws iam list-policies` from AWS's [how-to page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-iam-policy.html) and searching through the results)

##### Upload files and run transcription command
6. Then figure out how to upload the files from my Mac to the S3 bucket programmatically. For now, uploaded manually by opening the [S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/upload/recordings.smolkin.org?region=us-west-1)
	1. I set this up on EC2 and did this just a couple days ago with the log files, so it can't be too hard to set up on my Mac
	2. Here's the command I'll run: `aws s3 cp /path/to/your/audio/file s3://your-bucket-name/path/in/bucket/` 
7. When using the AWS CLI, you'll need to handle special characters, such as spaces, by enclosing the S3 URL in double quotes to prevent parsing errors. Well, you should escape the spaces in the S3 URL using backslashes or enclose it in double quotes, if there's an error.[^2] 
8. Transcribe the recordings (can be run inside cloud console as well). 
	1. No matter how hard I tried, I was unable to get GPT-3.5 to generate the command properly for me.[^2] FINALLY! The issue was how `--media` was supposed to be handled: `--media MediaFileUri=s3://{bucket_name}/path/to/file`
	2. Update: it's best to put these inside a separate folder that contains nothing from previous days, as all files in this directory will be used when generating the translation. So don't use `recordings.smokin.org/results`, rather use `recordings.smolkin.org/results/transcriptions/{today's date}`
```
# Transcribe New Recording 8.m4a
aws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews --language-code ru-RU --media MediaFileUri=s3://recordings.smolkin.org/BoruchGorinLectureAudiosForDad/New\ Recording\ 8.m4a --output-bucket-name recordings.smolkin.org --output-key results/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Transcribe New Recording 9.m4a
aws transcribe start-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia --language-code ru-RU --media MediaFileUri=s3://recordings.smolkin.org/BoruchGorinLectureAudiosForDad/New\ Recording\ 9.m4a --output-bucket-name recordings.smolkin.org --output-key results/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

##### Retrieve completed transcriptions
9. List all transcription jobs in your AWS account, including their status, and you can check if the new job with your specified job name has completed successfully: `aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs`
	1. You can also run it with the specific job name: `aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs --query "TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=='BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews']"`
10. Once the transcription job is completed (i.e. `TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=={JobName}]["TranscriptionJobStatus"] == "COMPLETED"`, you can use the AWS CLI to retrieve the transcription results: `aws transcribe get-transcription-job --transcription-job-name BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews --output json`
11. This part is much better to do once you have that IAM access working (otherwise, accessing files is a huge pain with AWS S3): The transcription results are stored in the S3 bucket and folder/object specified by the `OutputBucketName` and `OutputKey` parameters when the job was created. You can use the `cp` command to copy the transcription file from S3 to the local computer/server: `aws s3 cp s3://recordings.smolkin.org/results/BoruchGorin1-Recording8-IsPutinAFriendToTheJews.json ./`, `aws s3 cp s3://recordings.smolkin.org/results/BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia.json ./`
12. Create a transitional text file that will be used for the automated translation. Also, this is the result of the transcription. Hooray!

11:
```sh
for file in *.json; do
    jobName=$(jq -r '.jobName' "$file")
    jobDetails=$(aws transcribe list-transcription-jobs --query "TranscriptionJobSummaries[?TranscriptionJobName=='${jobName}']")
    languageCode=$(echo "$jobDetails" | jq -r '.[0].LanguageCode')
    completionTime=$(echo "$jobDetails" | jq -r '.[0].CompletionTime')
    fileNameDate=$(date -d "$completionTime" +'%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')
    fileName="./${jobName}_${languageCode}_${fileNameDate}_transcript.txt"
    jq -r '.results.transcripts[0].transcript' "$file" > "$fileName"
	
	# en and en-US both work
    # aws translate start-text-translation-job --input-data-config S3Uri="s3://recording.smolkin.org/results/$file" --output-data-config S3Uri="s3://recording.smolkin.org/results/$outputFileName" --data-access-role-arn arn:aws:iam::021741100599:role/TranslateFullAccess --source-language-code "$languageCode" --target-language-codes en-US # Error: first couldn't create IAM keys and get arn to work
	# translatedFileName="./${jobName}_${languageCode}_${fileNameDate}_translated.txt"; aws translate translate-text --text "$(cat "$fileName")" --source-language-code "$languageCode" --target-language-code en --output text > "$translatedFileName" # Error: An error occurred (TextSizeLimitExceededException) when calling the TranslateText operation: Input text size exceeds limit. Max length of request text allowed is 10000 bytes while in this request the text size is 41011 bytes
    # for file in *_transcript.txt; do transcribedText=$(cat "$file"); translatedText=$(aws translate translate-text --text "$transcribedText" --source-language-code $languageCode --target-language-code en); echo "$translatedText" > "${file%.txt}_en.txt"; done # never checked this one
done
```

[^3]
13. Send the file(s) to AWS Translate [Synchronous, O(n^2) solution (moved to the bottom of the document, because it has too many flaws)]. This can actually be done without step 11. Step 11 can be replaced with just two more calls to the API.

##### Translate transcriptions and download files
14. (Optional: AWS CloudShell Directions) If this was done in the AWS CloudShell, download all resulting files to the desktop. This step should be unnecessary, once all permissions have been configured and it's done completely in the cloud
	1. Go to the directory (probably `~`) where you saved all your requests. `cd; ls`. Copy the output of `ls`
	2. In the upper right corner of the CloudShell, click 'Actions <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 16 16" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true"><path class="filled stroke-linejoin-round" d="M4 5h8l-4 6-4-6z"></path></svg> -> Download file' ![[images/Screenshot 2023-07-26 at 10.09.53 AM.png]]
	3. Sequentially, paste the path to each file and press Download
15. Manual:
	1. If doing just a couple files, I can manually do the translations. After completing step 14, go to `https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#translation` and upload the file there
	2. Or I can manually run the batches:
		1. Copy the files back to the folder from which you'll be calling them: `aws s3 cp BoruchGorin2-Recording9-HowLongCanJewsStayInRussia_ru-RU_2023-07-26_06-04-30_transcript.txt s3://recordings.smolkin.org/transcriptions/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`
			1. ⚠️ don't forget the `/` at the end of the folder name! otherwise, s3 will actually copy your file to a new file with the same name as the directory, e.g. creating a new file called "s3://recordings.smolkin.org/transcriptions"
			2. the output folder creates a directory for this job. the input folder uses all files in the input. so you need to separate files in this job from files in other jobs, probably by using a subdirectory. this is relevant when making the output of the transcription, so you don't have to move the file once it gets to this point
		2. https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#create-batch-translation
		3.  Just ran the AWS translation using the website. I should've done this from the start. They still don't give me a CLI command to do this automatically, but they were willing to generate an AWS Translate IAM role for me that works (although IDK how to use it outside of manually using the AWS translation batch)
		4.  To retrieve the data:
			1.  Open the job: https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/translate/home?region=us-west-1#batch-details/126ac04db7b95bb1bb0f03b541d19cb8
			2.  Then click on "Output file location" ![[images/Screenshot 2023-07-26 at 11.15.59 AM.png]]
			3.  And then get to the file data and click "Open" or "Download"
[^1]: Note down the response. This is the info you'll need to use this account. It is only shown once. I used to do this manually using their website, so you can do that if you want. It's actually surprisingly intuitive. Or you can just use these commands, which I've already gathered, to do the same thing.
```json
{
    "AccessKey": {
        "UserName": "TranscribeUser",
        "AccessKeyId": "[the access key is here]",
        "Status": "Active",
        "SecretAccessKey": "[the key secret is here]",
        "CreateDate": "2023-07-26T00:40:31+00:00"
    }
}
```


[^2]:  So back to Google it is. But it did give me a good starting point with which to search. ~~The final google string that found me what I needed: google "aws transcribe command example" -> "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/transcribe/index.html" -> "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/transcribe/start-transcription-job.html" or not~~. I guess I keep trekking. google "Error parsing parameter '--media': Expected: '=', received: 'EOF' for input:" -> https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/aws-cli-error-parsing-parameter-expected-receved-eof [doesn't apply to me] or https://www.roelpeters.be/solve-error-parsing-parameter-expectedreceived-eof-for-input-aws-cli/. I'm sure these'll help someone, but they don't help me. google "aws cli transcribe expected =" -> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/getting-started-cli.html FINALLY! It was able to handle spaces without a problem if you escaped them, as I'd originally expected.

[^3]: since I was never able to figure out the arn (actually, maybe I finally did figure it out at 2:35 a.m., but then they hit me with another error: `Missing required parameter in InputDataConfig: "ContentType"`), I'll be switching to the simpler `aws translate translate-text` as shown in [their example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/get-started-cli.html)
