Long time ago, I was a transport economics guy. The other day I was thinking about the different existent data roles. I came up with the following metaphors:
- Data platform builds the roads, harbours, railroads and airports
- Data Engineering do the heavy transport
- DS makes the last mile

This creates some ego problems. DS think they do all the work. Data Engineering and Data platform folks are really far away from the customers, don't get enough credit and feel disconnected from the business.
