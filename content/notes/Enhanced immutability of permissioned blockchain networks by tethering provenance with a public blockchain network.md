# Summary
This paper notes that existing permissioned blockchains are susceptible to an attack where some of the permissioned participants collude to rewrite the chain. They propse a solution where the current state of the permissioned blockchain is _tethered_ to a public blockchain such as Ethereum using one or more smart contracts. This would allow the permissioned blockchain to leverage the security of the many participants in a public blockchain.
