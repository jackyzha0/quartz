A new form for human-information interface using a virtual environment. Encompasses VR, AR, MR. Aims to create interactions that embody [[ubiquitous-computing]]

## Hype Cycles
This technology has historically been very affected by [[hype-cycles]]. There was a large boom when XR hardware became affordable and available, and game engines such as [[unity]] and [[unreal-engine]] made developing XR applications much easier. 

## Usage
- just in time information for instructions remote experts etc
- [[augmented-reality|AR]] with [[industrial-internet-of-things|IIoT]] devices
- training with 360 video for Walmart etc
- entertainment. virtual experiences etc.
- telepresence
- [[vr-therapy|VR Therapy]]. (exposure therapy etc)
- [[volumetric-video]]. 

## Challenges
- we need to understand human perception and cognition
- post WIMP interaction
- precise [[localisation-and-tracking]]
- how to interact with big data (immersive analytics?)
- how to make invisible interfaces
- how to make intelligent interfaces
- how to enable [[presence]] and [[telepresence]]

## Displays
The most common form factor of visual XR experience is with a [[head-mounted-display]].

The other main form factor is [[spatial-augmented-reality]] which uses large screens and projection to enhance physical objects, and create environments

Some XR experiences also include [[haptics]] and acoustic, thermal, and olfactory elements 

## Interaction
we are used to using  a keyboard and mouse. So how can we learn to interact with more complex environments

- Gestures → using hand gestures as input
- Controllers → smartphones, joysticks etc (mohr)
	- Not good for crowded/social environments
- Touch pads on HMD (gugenheimer 2016)
- Eye tracking (lee 2016)
