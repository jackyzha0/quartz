# Policies
Defn: a plan or course of action to influence and determine decisions

- high level rules regarding operations of organisation
- policies state the management intent and will
- governments, businesses, political parties, universities etc

provide roadmap for day-to-day operations
- organisation internal law
	- also comply with actual law
- important for resolution of legal disputes
	- provide accountability
	- can protect org and employees
- ensure consistency
	- dont often change or deteriorate when staff changes
- evidence of quality control, internal audits etc

## good policies 
are properly
- disseminated
- read
- understood
- agreed-to
- uniformly enforced

and help us to answer these questions
- what info should be collected
- how should it be stored
- who is responsible for managing it
- who can access it
- what info should be published
- how long should it be kept/maintained
- when should it be discarded

## example
Revealing Information To Prospective Employee
Policy: Information systems technical details, such as network addresses, network diagrams, and security software employed, must not be revealed to job applicants until they have signed a confidentiality agreement and also have been hired or retained

# Procedures
Defn: step by step descriptions of what employees must do to achieve a certain goal (as specified by a policy)

- must be kept separate from policies
- keeping them together will create a complex document that will (likely) not be read
