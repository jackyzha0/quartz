[modelling-behaviour](notes/modelling-behaviour.md)

- method signatures
- inheritance of behaviour
- lower level sequencing and flow of control
- compartmentalisation into "subsystems"

1. Compare and contrast the two typical approaches to inheriting behaviour in OO systems. 
2. What does it mean to “program to an interface�? and why is this important?
3. Compare and contrast “rich�? versus “anaemic�? domain models with regards to behaviour.
4. Give an example of a “processor�? in the context of OO system design and explain why these are useful.

# 2 Inheritance

## 2.1 Inheriting behaviour via specialisation

e.g., 

- subclass of item
	- inherit all public members of Item
	- can replace or customeise any intherited method
	- can add their own specialised methods (including constructors)
	- can’t concurrently be subclasses of anything else (single inheritance)
- Things that know how to use Item will also accept Book or Disc.

### 2.1.1 Specialisation in Java

## 2.2 Inheriting behaviour via implenting an interface

![](https://i.imgur.com/tZX8uQT.png)

- Search specifies a set of common behaviour.
	- public methods and constant fields only (no variable fields)
	- effectively an “inheritable�? public API (no implementation) ⇒ Catalogue must implement all Search methods
	- independent of inheritance via specialisation
	- a class can implement multiple interfaces
- Things that know how to use Search will also accept Catalogue.

### 2.2.1 Interface in java

![](https://i.imgur.com/2cXr5CM.png)

- Examples of built-in Java interfaces: (also see INFO 202) 
- Collection: collections of objects (lists, sets, maps, …) 
- Iterable: collections that can be iterated over 
- Comparable: objects that have a concept of ordering

## 2.3 Public API vs private implementation

- The public API defines what a class can do 
	- e.g., read and write data, manage a list of items 
	- effectively a “promise�? or “contract�? to other classes that use it 
	- should be as stable as possible 

- The private implementation defines how a class behaves 
	- e.g., data stored in memory vs. CSV files vs. SQL DBMS vs. …, unsorted lists vs. sorted vs. unique vs. … 
	- can change to improve speed, reduce memory, redesign architecture, take advantage of new language features, …
	- shouldn’t be exposed to other classes

## 2.4 Why public and private are decoupled

- More stable public API: 
	- doesn’t expose internal implementation details 
	- can change internals without breaking promised behaviour

- More flexible public API: 
	- less coding required to switch implementations 
	- can easily switch internal implementations on the fly (e.g., print receipt vs. save as PDF vs. send as email) 
- Programming to an interface (i.e., public API): 
	- encapsulate public API into a class or (Java) interface 
	- subclass or implement this to create specific implementations 
	- use the top-level class or interface everywhere you would otherwise use the specialised implementations

## 2.5 Java collection interface example

- A collection is a container for groups of objects: 
	- e.g., lists, sets, stacks, trees, … 
	- common behaviour (public API): add, remove, count items, … 
	- specialised behaviour (private implementation): indexing, uniqueness, sorting, … 
- Java’s Collection interface defines common behaviour: 
	- add() or remove() items 
	- get size() of collection 
	- … 
- All Java collection types implement Collection. 

Anything coded to work with Collection will accept *any* Java collection type. (e.g., ArrayList, HashSet, TreeMap, …)

### 2.5.1 Bad example

![](https://i.imgur.com/89PjFdT.png)

- Internal details (ArrayList) are exposed in public API. 
- What if requirements change so that each product can appear only once? (requires HashSet) 
- Could change all ArrayList to HashSet, but: 
	- need to update everywhere getAllProducts() and getProductsByName() are called! (⇒ massive breakage potential) 
	- what if requirements change again

### 2.5.2 Good Example

![](https://i.imgur.com/j33SjYm.png)


- Public API specifies Collection. (general) 
- Private implementation uses ArrayList. (specific) 
- Everything outside Inventory sees only Collection. (internal details not exposed)
- Can switch to HashSet, TreeSet, … without breaking anything.

# 3 Behaviour in Domain models

## 3.1 Rich domain models

- True OO involves sending objects “native instructions�? beyond basic getter/setter methods: 
	- e.g., they can save, display, update, validate, etc., themselves 
	- often requires communicating with other objects 
- Advantages: 
	- better encapsulation ⇒ more scope for reuse 
	- methods are highly cohesive (focused) 
	- natural fit with programming to an interface 
- Disadvantages: 
	- many “chicken and egg�? situations ⇒ harder to use 
	- bordering on taking things too far (too much abstraction) 
	- well beyond comfort zone of many developers (“exotic�?)

### 3.1.1 Rich domain example: Library system

## 3.2 Contrast with anaemic domain models

- Objects have relatively little “native�? behaviour: (if any) 
	- mostly just state 
	- don’t inherit from anything else (class or interface) 
	- getters/setters don’t really encapsulate much 
	- methods manipulate only internal state (no external communication) 
	- generally referred to as JavaBeans in Java (also POJO) 
- Require a lot of “plumbing�? code to shift data into and out of objects so we can do something useful with it. 
- De facto standard for most programmers/systems

## 3.3 Reducing the plumbing in anaemic models 

- Frequently need to move data between domain objects and other (sub)systems, e.g.: 
	- GUI components (see INFO 202) 
	- data stores (also see Lecture 17) 
	- barcode management subsystem 
	- shipping (sub)system 
	- inventory (sub)system 
	- … 
- “Processor objects�? can encapsulate these interactions: 
	- effectively “(sub)system APIs�? that group related behaviour 
	- either classes or (Java) interfaces, as appropriate 
	- methods take relevant domain objects as arguments 
- Third-party frameworks can reduce the amount of code you need to write even further. (see INFO 202)

# 4 Lecture summary 

- There are a variety of behavioural diagrams in UML. 
- Behaviour can be inherited directly via specialisation, or indirectly by implementing an interface. 
- interfaces decouple public API from private implementation 
- programming to an interface 
- Domain models can be “rich�? or “anaemic�?. 
- anaemic more common 
- use “processors�? to encapsulate “plumbing�? code
