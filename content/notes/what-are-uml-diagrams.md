A standard set of constructs and notation defined by the object management group for creating [models](notes/models.md)

**specify what not how**

- activity diagrams
	- high level for business prcesses workflows
	- low level for dtailed business logicP
- advantages
	-  describe workflows
	- specify relative processing rder of activites
	- simple
	- can be shown to stakeholders for checking and confirmation

enables implementation-independent specification of:
- user/system interactions
- partitioning of responsibility
- integration with larger or existing systems
- data flow and dependency
- order of operations (algorithms and processes)
- concurrent operations

## 1 why is is useful
- helps develop efficient effective correct designs
- better communication with project stakeholders
- gives a big picture view of the project system
- independent of specific programming languages or development processes
- de facto standard for modelling OO systems

## 2 what it is not
- visual modelling software
- a programming languages
- a software development process, method, or methodology

## 3 Types of diagram

### 3.3 Linked diagrams
each digram type models a dfiferenct aspect of the system
many of the diagrams link to each other
- e.g., use case, sequence, activity
- e.g., object, communication

e.g.,
