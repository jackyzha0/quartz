To whom it may concern,

My name is Jet Hughes and I have a keen interest in renting the apartment you have available at 128 Forth St.

I currently live at 597 George St and have lived there for 6 months. I am looking for a new place to live because I want to move out of my studio room and into a flat with close friends. I find your flat particularly appealing because it is close to the Uni, has a nice view and looks very clean and tidy.

I believe I'd be a wonderful tentant at this property — and here's why. I am employed part-time Company-X and have been working there for 2 years. I am also studying Computer Science at the University of Otago. In my free time, I snowboard, surf, and love hiking. I also enjoy reading, drawing, cooking, and gardening.

I am quiet and friendly, a good tenant who always pays bills on time. Along with several references from previous landlords, my snowboard coach, and my current project manager.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call or e-mail me at 027 650 9548 or jethughes0@gmail.com.

Thank you very much for considering my rental application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Jet Hughes
