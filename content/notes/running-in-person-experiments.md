# Ethical considerations
participants can feel pressured

get informed consent

remind them that your testing the site.. not them

paticipants feel good about finding issues, not bad about not being able to do something

# Experiement details
- order
	- e.g., start simple, shuffle order
- training
	- depends on how th real system will be used
- DNF
	- set a time limit
	- maybe provide help if needed
- pilot
	- iron out the kinks in the study design
	- can also find very obvious issues that should be addressed so the actual participants aren't "wasted"

# capturing results
- note down critical incidents
	- aha moments, stores to share, big problems
- record video
	- lets to grab moments easily and share them
- screen recording
	- depends if you are interested on their expressions or th interface
- interupptions
	- yes/no

# Greeting participants
welcome, explain setup, scenarios,

# collecting data
- process data
	- observations (qualittative)
- bottom line data
	- numbers
	- i.e., dependent variables

# measuring bottom line usability
useful:
- time requirements
- success/fail
	- define in advance what this is
- compare speed or # of errors

dont combine with think aloud

# debrief
tell them what you goals are.

learn more holistically what they are thinking
