comb log. circuits always produce the same output with the same inputs

Sequential logic circuit output depends not only on the inputs but also past history (memory)

Two types:
- synchronous
	- changes of state happen in time with a clock cycle
	- input changes occur between clock pulses
	- state changes occur at the clock pulses
- asynchronous
	- We will not be studying these
	- State changes occur as changes in inputs occur
	- Event driven
