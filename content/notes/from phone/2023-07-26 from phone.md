Just got a voicemail, and I had a funny thought: I should make my voicemail message include pressing one. So if any telemarketers or spammers are calling me, they think that I've press one and that I am listening to them

How to beat the machine:
In my message, begin by saying “if you’re a person, please disregard the following two beeps”
Follow this with the typical “finished recording” beep, then “and this one,” then follow it with the beep that you hear when someone presses the one key.
Then quickly say my voicemail message.

This way, telemarketing machines will be connected to a live person, wasting their time, while my phone has gone to voicemail.

Only do this with phone numbers that are not in my contacts.
