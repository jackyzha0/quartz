trying to get be "fluent"


# Notes

vibrations at different freqiencies

only 12 notes

white notes - a-g

black notes - sharp and flat a-g

multiples of the frequencies at differnt multiples. each multiple an octave

semitone - gap between each note e.g., f-f#

## Key/scale

common combinations of notes that we know sound good together.

usualyy 7 notes in a key (major and minor)

C major - all white keys

scale - same as key basically. 

you can play a different set of notes (a scale) over the base key. e.g., a blues-e (pentatonic something) solo over e major

root note - note that we start the scale on

major pattern - 2 wholetones 1 semitone 3 whole tones 1 semitone

numbering notes - each note in a scale is given a number: 1 is the root note, then 2, then 3 etc

accidental - a flat for sharp note
