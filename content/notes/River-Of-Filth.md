song choice


what we witnessed was trulyincreible
all kinds of people came together
united by one purpose

using each other strength to stand up

defying to be silenced

unfortunatel those elected to represent the people failed to do just that

instead the government signed a pact promising not to talk with the people

the accredited media deployed a vicious smear campaign in an effort to turn public opinion agains the people

but due to the many peopple filming the truth was seen worldwide

this was made in recognition of the thoursands who have suffered at the hands of this govt

to the many who held the line

to the many who sacrificed so much

you are never alone

in memory of the freedom camp
