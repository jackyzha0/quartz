# Concept 1 - Snowboard trick generator. 

This will be a mobile app that snowboarders can use to automatically generate random tricks. This app will be useful because snowboarders (riders) often get tunnel vision on a certain style of tricks or even a single trick. Using a algorithm to generate tricks provides a way for them to escape this focus. It can also be used when playing a game of SNOW, which is similar to a game of SKATE.

# Initial Ideas
- customisable trick generator
	- trick lists --> users can create lists for the generator to choose a trick from
		- some built in lists
		- share lists with friends
	- options
		- trick types
			- jump
			- rail
			- pipe
			- butters
		- flips
		- spins
		- grabs
		- spin direction
		- bring back or not
		- stance
			- regular
			- goofy
- daily trick
	- same for all users?
	- auto notification
	- schedule
		- weekly
		- custom
		- auto when at an altitude
- App widget with daily trick? 
- search for tricks
	- options similar to generator
	- save tricks to a list for generator
- link with other users
	- methods
		- qr code
		- url/link
		- contact
		- social media
	- people
		- friends
		- coach
		- parents
	- features
		- daily/sheduled trick group
			- how would this work with altitude detector
		- share trick lists
		- community section for trick lists
			- like spotify playlists
		- users can share tutorials
- Ease of use - (hard to use with gloves)
	- voice controls
	- gesture controls
- goals tracking
	- goal lists
	- daily/weekly/yearly goals
	- trick generator can choose a trick from goals
	- share (or keep private) with coach and friends
	- trick tutorials

# Final Choices
### Core features
- customisable generator
	- all options no trick lists
- daily trick
	- Notification
	- able to set a schedule or have it go when at an altitude
- links with friends
	- Do same tricks
	- link with QR code or url

The first core feature of the app is the customisable trick generator. It should be very easy and quick to use. This presents an interesting problem as while snowboarding, users are wearing large mittens, and the air can be very cold for hands. It would be ideal if it could be used while wearing mittens. 

The second core feature of the app is the Daily Trick. This means that users get a notification with a random trick from the trick generator. This feature could allows users to get the benefit of the trick generator without having to open the app on the mountain. However, the issue here is that most people don't snowboard everyday. To get around this, I could allow the users to schedule days on which to recieve a daily trick, or I could alert them whenever they are on a mountain by monitoring their altitude. Of course the second option has some privacy issues that will need to be considered.

The third core feature of the app is the link with friends. This is a core feature because snowboarders will typically rider with a group of friends. Being able to join a 'trick group' means these groups can do the same trick and 'compete' against each other.

## Summary
### Overview
I was able to find only 7 apps with similar functionality to what I am planning. Of these none 5 were for skateboarding 2 for other sports and zero for snowboarding. 

### Functionality of the apps
These 7 apps all had varying degreee of complexity. Some were just simple customizable trick generators, while others were fully fledged coaching and goal tracking apps with community features and other extras. Although I am not planning to make large complicated app, I can still draw from them for guidance as most of them did have a trick generator. 

Aesthetic/style of the apps


Conclusion


## Skate Dice
Skate dice was one of the most intresting the apps I found. It had a very unique approach using a "shake the phone" gesture to "roll" the dice. However it has a paywall for premium features such as more tricks, settings, and a "tricktionary".  From what I was able to use I think is was the most simple and intuitive apps. It also had an aesthetic that fit the culture of the sport. All these features combined made it very enjoyable to use. 

### How does this app inform mine
- Keep design simple
- Maybe incorporate some gestures
- Consider using an aesthetic wich matches the culture/sport

## Skate tricks
This app is a much more fully featured solution. It is oriented towards learning skateboarding, and keeping track of you progress while doing it. It also has a built in trick generator, and game of skate. One of the most unique features it had that the other apps didn't was a trick of the day. This is one of the core features I want to include in my app. Another interesting feature it had was a page informing the user about injury prevention.
