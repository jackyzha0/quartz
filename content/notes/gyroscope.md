- know which direction is up/down
- calculated changes in orientation
- 3 degrees of freedom (rotation about X, Y, and Z)

**How it works**
- angular momentum (things want to keep spinning on the same axis)



- "orientation can be computed from the angular rate that is detected by the gyroscope, expressed in rad/s [deg/s] on 3 axis"
