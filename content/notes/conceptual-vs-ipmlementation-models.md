Models like ERDs are used to represent a high level conceptual overview of a system, or to as a lower level specification that can drive the implementation of the database.

**Conceptual

- Abstract/big-picture
- Useful in inital design stages and for communication

**Implementation

- Concrete/detailed
- Useful in documenting and specifying structure (for devs etc)
- Should be detailed and specific enough to allow a dev to implement it without having to guess at details
- Should be tailored to the specific implementation technologies or systems
