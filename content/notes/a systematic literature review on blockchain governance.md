# Summary
As the title states, this paper is a systematic literature review on blockchain governance. 

# Extracts

Research Questions
- What is blockchain governance?
- Why is blockchain governance adopted?
- Where is blockchain governance enforced?
- When is blockchain governance applied?
- Who is involved in blockchain governance?
- How is blockchain governance designed?

p9 “Blockchain governance refers to the structures and processes that are designed to ensure the development and use of blockchain are compliant to legal regulations and ethical responsibilities.”

p9 "Dimensions of blockchain governance: Blockchain consists of the three dimensions of decision rights, accountability, and incentives, whereby they should all align with the decentralisation level of deployed blockchain"

p10 "Adaptability and upgradability are the two main properties motivating the governance of blockchain, while some other identified motivations of blockchain governance are related to ethical values, e.g., security, fairness, privacy, which reflects the awareness of blockchain’s impact on human and society"

p10 Governance of blockchain itself — "governance of blockchain should determine how the platform is designed [49], for instance, infrastructure configuration (e.g. block size and interval) [41, 52, 62], and consensus protocol (e.g. transaction generation and confirmation process) [29, 36, 45]." "governance can facilitate the upgrade of platform to meet the new requirements according to users’ feedback and proposals [29, 40, 46, 52, 59]."

p10 Governance of the blockchain community — "governance of community places an emphasis on both formal and informal governance processes of different stakeholders and their collaborations via off-chain channels (e.g., Twitter, Reddit and GitHub) [29, 36, 37, 40, 59]." "Governance over community also includes institutional governance"

p14 "process mechanisms describe the steps of blockchain development via the governance meta-rules" "product mechanisms include the features of a blockchain, as the final outcomes of software development process."
