A law of software [[project-management]]. States that adding more people to a task, make the task take longer - not quicker.

“When schedule slippage is recognized, the (natural and traditional) response is to add manpower. Like dousing a fire with gasoline, this makes matters worse, much worse. More fire requires more gasoline, and thus begins a regenerative cycle which ends in disaster.” (Brooks)

**Adding manpower to a late software project will make it later**
