A subfield of [[artificial-intelligence|AI]] that focuses on creating [[intelligence|intelligent]] agents or systems that interact with their [[agent-environments|environment]] through physical bodies.

## Starting at the beginning 

How hard is it to build something like us? One way of measuring the difficulty of a task is to look at how long evolution took to discover a solution.

- Most of evolutionary time was spent designing robust systems for physical survival. 
- In this light, what’s ‘distinctively human’ seems relatively unimportant!

> [!INFO] playing chess etc, is the last thing that should come. we should solve all the easier problems that more simple organisms did first.
> focus on developing AI in a evolutionary sense.
> e.g., we don't have AI insects (like mars rover) ∴ we shouldn't work on chess ai yet

## An evolutionary approach to AI 
Proponents of embodied AI believe that in order to reproduce human intelligence, we need to retrace an evolutionary process: 

- We should begin by building robust systems that perform very simple tasks—but in the real world. 
- When we’ve solved this problem, we can progressively add new functionality to our systems, to allow them to perform more complex tasks. 
- At every stage, we need to have a robust, working real-world system. 

Maybe systems of this kind will provide a good framework on which to implement distinctively human capabilities. 
This line of thought is associated with a researcher called Rodney Brooks
