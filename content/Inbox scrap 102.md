CHAPTER THIRTEEN

“VACCINE PASSPORTS” AND THE END OF HUMAN LIBERTY

195

all human experience, fellowship and joy was put behind a paywall.

195

Not without your vaccination subscription. And your “booster” every five to eight months, probably forever, is the renewal of the subscription.

195

The messaging worldwide was the same: “The vaccine passport is the key to ending the pandemic and regaining ‘normal life.’”

195

Of course, proof of vaccination could be confirmed on a piece of paper. Were digital “passports” really needed?

195

digital as opposed to paper “vaccine passports” could require endless “updates” to stay valid. How did I know this? Because a digital product can be made to shut off.

196

Vaccine passports were truly the last step . . . the last fight that we had to fight. Because once the vaccine passports are accepted, there is no more resistance.

196

When you sign up on a website or on an app, you sign your name and you choose a password. And then there’s a list of terms and conditions. And you agree to them.

This seems insignificant, but it’s important because what it means is you have choice. You can read the terms and conditions and you can think: “This is too tyrannical; they’re going to sell my private details. I’m not willing to agree to these terms and conditions.”

And the password and username mean that you get to decide when you log on to TD Bank, or when you log on to PayPal. You’re not walking around your daily life logged into PayPal. You’re not walking around your daily life logged into a credit score. You’re in control.

196

With the vaccine passports, in contrast, none of that will be the case. Everyone must be participating all the time.

If you don’t participate, you eventually don’t get let into the supermarket to buy food. You don’t get let into the pub to meet your friends. You can’t get into the restaurant. You can’t travel on an airplane. You can’t travel on a bus. You can’t travel on a train. And it’s not just that you’re forced to participate.

196

The vaccine passport platform is the first step toward a social credit system, like the one in China that enslaves a billion people.

In China, the CCP can find any dissident in five minutes because of the 360-degree surveillance of the social credit system. It means that when you act like a “good” citizen, you get a boost to your score. And when you act like a “bad” citizen, opportunities get closed to you. Maybe your child doesn’t get into college or get into a prep school. Maybe you don’t get that job. You don’t get that promotion.

196

The vaccine passports being rolled out in the West could enable the same platform. Once rolled out, I warned, any other functionality could be linked to these passports within half an hour of coding.

It means that with a tweak of the backend, bank account access could be switched off and on, depending on how the underlying AI assesses what you’ve been saying on social media. So if you’ve been too conservative or too liberal, or you’ve used the words “President Trump” too often, or the words “pro-choice” or “Sierra Club” too often, a machine reading it could let your bank know; and your bank could switch off your access to your account, or dial up your interest on a credit card.

197

This mechanism can also directly manage dissent. With a tweak of the backend, those who control the mechanism can be sure never to grant you a “rejoin-society” or “I don’t have COVID” checkmark. You would be at the mercy of what the “passport” says about your status.

So if you’re a dissident, you can always be positive for COVID without much recourse to challenge it. And you’d be in a second-class category in society for the rest of your life. Your family would too.

197

Let’s consider a scenario. When you agree to the vaccine passports, when you go to a pub or a play or a restaurant, you will swipe that QR code.

Where does that information go? It goes to a central database, and the information of all the people who are with you, who are also swiping the code, is also going to a central database. This means that the “vaccine passport,” which is really a social credit system, knows everyone who’s at that table.

And if you’re talking online about resistance to the system, if you’re talking about staging a protest or writing an op-ed or mobilizing support for a representative to pass a bill to roll back this system, the platform can know. There’s a functionality that creates maps of networks of people.

198

As you all swipe in your vaccine passport to that café or to that restaurant, or even in your living room, the software is geolocating you. It can also tabulate the searches you have done historically. And it can read what happened on your collective social media as a group. And you, as a group, can be blackballed. Your social credit score can dial down.

198

There is now also a global a push toward government-managed digital currencies.259 With a digital currency, if you’re not a “good citizen,” if you pay to see a movie you shouldn’t see, if you go to a play you shouldn’t go to, which the vaccine passport will know because you have to scan it everywhere you go, then your revenue stream can be shut off or your taxes can be boosted or your bank account won’t function.

198

There is no coming back from this.

I was asked by a reporter, “What if Americans don’t adopt this?”

And I said, “You’re already talking from a world that’s gone if this succeeds in being rolled out.” Because if we don’t reject the vaccine passports, there won’t be any choice. There will be no such thing as refusing to adopt it.

199

the definition of “fully vaccinated” continued to evolve.263
