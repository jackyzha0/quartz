## Our capacity to imagine potential outcomes activates the dopamine anticipation response  # 

[[Mental simulations evolved to allow us to anticipate potential outcomes and make the best approach]]. But in some instances these same types of simulations get hijacked by the process in which [[a dopamine release occurs when we explore and evaluate the potential value of novel objects and situations]], leading us to spend time “elsewhere” when we should be doing something else. This process is what we ordinarily call daydreaming. Daydreaming is a great example of our attention being diverted from the task at hand.
