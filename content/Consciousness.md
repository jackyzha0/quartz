## Consciousness  #⏳ 

Consciousness is the fifth of [[the five aggregates]]. It is defined as cognition arisen through [[sense impression]]. The cause and condition for the manifestation of consciousness is [[mind-body]]. 

It is important to note that consciousness, rather than recognizing an object, is only a sort of awareness—awareness of the presence of a sense object. When the eye comes in contact with a color, for instance blue, visual consciousness arises which is simply an awareness of the presence of a color; but it does not recognize that it is blue. There is no recognition at this stage. It is the third aggregate, [[perception]], that recognizes that it is blue. The term ‘visual consciousness’ is a philosophical expression denoting the same idea as is conveyed by the ordinary word ‘seeing’. Seeing does not mean recognizing. So Is the same for the other forms of consciousness.

Consciousness also should not be taken as a self or soul in opposition to matter. This must be emphasized because the mistaken notion that consciousness is a self enclosed entity that continues as an unchanging substance throughout life has been adobted my many philosophical doctrines form the earliest times to the present day. [[The Buddha]] describes consciousness as being named according to whatever condition through which it arises. He explains this further through the following illustration: "A fire may burn on account of wood, and it is called wood-fire. It may burn on account of straw, and then it is called straw-fire. So consciousness is named according to the condition through which it arises."
