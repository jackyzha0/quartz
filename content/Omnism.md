## Omnism  # 

Omnism is the recognition and respect of all religions and their gods or lack thereof. Omnism is similar to syncretism, the belief in a fusion of faiths in harmony. However, it can also be seen as a way to accept the existence of various religions without believing in all that they profess to teach. Many omnists say that all religions contain truths, but that no one religion offers all that is truth.

Some omnists interpret this to mean that all religions contain varying elements of a common truth, or place omnism in opposition to dogmatism, in that omnists are open to potential truths from all religions.

In this regard, omnism does not appear to be a form of [theology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology"), as it neither espouses nor opposes particular beliefs about [God](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God "God"). Instead, it affirms the necessity of one arriving at an understanding of reality based on personal experience, engagement, and inquiry, and an acceptance of the validity and legitimacy of the differing understandings of others
