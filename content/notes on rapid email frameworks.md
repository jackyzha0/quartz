# Module #2: Rapid Email Frameworks (How to Write Persuasive Emails Fast)

Emails that you only send once in an email sequence.

30 minutes writing and 10-20 minutes editing
Write fast by having:
- Research
- Frameworks that work (these boosts your confidence that your emails will deliver)

Before writing you must already have done the research about
- who you are writing the emails to (their fears, desires, needs, beliefs, identifications)
- why it's beneficial for them to buy and buy now (features, benefits, USP, elevator pitch, value proposition)
- why they should pick you over the competition (research competitor's promises, sales messages, guarantees, etc.)

## Killer email elements

1. Subject line
2. Opening sentence (pattern interrupt)
3. The body
4. They segue
5. The ask

Only 4 elements in the frameworks

## 1. What, Not How

- Tell them what the problem is.
	- Educate if needed.
- Tell them what to do to solve it.
	- Give them a step-by-step if needed.
- Tease or hint that the true solution is in the product or just by clicking the link.
	- That's where the how is

Why it works
- You are demonstrating expertise, insight
- You are solving their problem
- You are helping them get closer to their dreams

## 2. Troll/Hater Email

- You can use someone who trolled you or the trolls of someone you are following.
- First line: use a climactic first line that grabs your attention.
	-  I finally got my first hater
	- Someone trolled me the other day
	- This is my first troll this week
- Give context
	- Show what they said by posting the question or a screenshot (blur the name)
- Give commentary or answer the troll: Why he's wrong, right. What makes him wrong or right.
- Commend the right. Expose the wrong. (Point everything or just one thing)
- If you'd like to learn more (the real way, the fast way, a more ethical way). To do this, then go here and get [product].

Why it works
- People like drama and story and conflict
- This filters people who are not meant to be your audience

## 3. How to X without Y even if Z

- If you're trying to (blank), then here are a few things I've discovered that (blank).
- List each one and briefly explain what and why, not how.
- Want to know a simple way to make all these things happen at once?
- Get my product.
- CTA

Why it works
- It's a teaser to the real product.

## 4. Here's Why, Not How

- I saw something the other day OR I heard this ridiculous thing OR I realized something OR tell them something that troubled you
- Here's WHY that's a problem/Why you think that happened
- Tell them the point/moral/lesson
- Link to the product
- CTA

Why it works
- Good for daily emails or broadcast emails
- It's topical and relevant
- It's insightful because it came from you (if they are in your list, share something personal because they want to know something about you)

## 5. Poralizing

- Use this if you have a contrarian view against a popular or prevailing statement
- Format
	- People are going to hate me for saying this, but I'm going to say it anyway
	- Controversial statement
	- Defend (Here's why)
	- Link to product
	- CTA

## 6. Correlation

- Explain a topic your prospects already understand or explain it quickly in a way that makes it easy to understand.
	- Sports, politics, religion, etc.
	- Or find something in your living room or office and connect it to a feature of the product you are selling.
- How does this topic relate to the market's problems and solutions?
- Create a correlation to check your product.
- Give them a "push" to take action.

## 7. News email

- Similar to correlation emails but topic 1 is the news.
- Format:
	- I saw this news the other day.
	- Here's what happened.
	- It reminds me/It's kinda like/The reason this matters because
	- State the point
	- Segue to your product
	- CTA

Why it works
- It's topical
- You connect it with your product

## 8. Situation, Problem, Implication, Next (SPIN)

- From Ray Edwards
- Format
	- Are you in this situation right now? And you want to go from here to here?
	- Here are the common problems to from A-Z
	- Imply the work involved.
		- You spent money, time, and effort.
		- You did a lot of "leg work" to find what works.
	- There is a shortcut!
		- It's called [unique mechanism] and this is why this shortcut works.
	- What's it? Here's what you need to do next.


## 9. Goal, Realistic, Overview, What's Next (GROW)

- This is your goal, right? You want X, Y, and Z without A, B, C.
	- Ex: Do you want to become a $10k/mo copywriter?
- Here are the realistic things you can do to achieve goal
- Overview of the steps to get there
- What's next?
	- If you want to get that WITHOUT doing all three or want to get it faster, join my program.
- The tone of this framework is like a friend that is wise.

Why it works:
- Shows that you emphatize.
- 

## Welcome email

most opened email (80%)

Framework 1
- fulfills original promise from opt in
- presents expectations (tell everything)
- tells who to unsubscribe
- builds curiosity for future emails (normally a bullet)
- introduces personality, beliefs, and methods (introduce yourself)
- polarizes (what you stand against, what you hate)
- provide cliffhanger (e.g., on my second email, I am going to show you how to create a...)
- sign off

Framework 2 (polarizing; useful in a sophisticated niche like fitness)
- Call them out as different and congratulate them on making the choice to improve their life (trigger belonging and the cognitive bias of being congratulated from past decisions)
- Invalidate other solutions and make them the enemy (e.g., I'm not like other blank who blank)
- Tell them you'll be sharing something you've never shared before
- Tell what to expect (bullets)
- Tell them the free stuff is better than other paid stuff and that they need to take action (or in the past you will pay for this but I am giving it now for free; )
- Fulfill promise from opt-in
- Tell them who should unsubscribe. (This is important to save your client money)
