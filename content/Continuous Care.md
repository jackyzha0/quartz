Be the watchful caretaker of your ever growing plants and flowers. Grow your knowledge by forming new branches and connecting the dots. Write short structured notes articulating specific ideas and share them. Avoid creating or nourishing orphan notes. Anything not connected eventually needs to go. We must: refine our ideas, thread our thoughts, and keep notes [[./Atomic Notes|atomic]].

Taking raw notes is _useless_. Seed your garden with quality content and cultivate your curiosity. Plant seeds in your mind garden by taking smart personal notes. These don't need to be written in a publishable form.
