How could we make everything as fun as possible?

For me, living in Los Baños is like living in a pretend world. I always see Mt. Makiling and the wilderness there but I haven't stepped into its wilderness. I kid myself that I am living in Nature and yet walking around LB is an act of looking for what is left of Nature.

It has been 12 years ago. In eight years, 20 years ago. And soon it will be forgotten

Nen saman
Diyad Sta. Maria
Sano onlukas laray bungay mais
Tan nanengneng laray duyaw a butil
Onggapo met lan
Ondago iray kumpapey
Ed silesilew mid abung nu labi
Tan agkami la makasabad satan
Ya manggogoy sali mi
Ikapot miray bintana
Tan saliey onugip anggano
Ampetang
Alagarey kabuwasan sano
Napanoy datal mi
Na nampulbon paya-payak
Ya panisen mi tan panisen lamet
Nabuas
Anggad sano naburbor iray mais
Ed beneg mi.

Mt data smells of bulok na mangoes
