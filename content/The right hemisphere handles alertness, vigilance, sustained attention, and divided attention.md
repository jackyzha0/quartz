## The right hemisphere handles alertness, vigilance, sustained attention, and divided attention # 

Vigilance and sustained attention are grossly impaired in subjects with [[right hemisphere]] lesions, especially right [[frontal lobe]] lesions; by contrast, in patients with [[left hemisphere]] lesions (therefore relying on their intact [[right hemisphere]]) vigilance is preserved. Patients with [[right hemisphere]] lesions also exhibit what is called perceptuomotor slowing, a sign of diminished alertness, associated with lapses of attention. Studies in both healthy subjects and split-[[brain]] patients corroborate the role of the [[right hemisphere]] in the ‘intensity’ aspects of attention; and scanning studies provide further confirmatory evidence of [[right hemisphere]] dominance in alertness and sustained attention. Overall it appears clear that intensity (alertness, vigilance and sustained attention) is reliant on the [[right hemisphere]]. While some studies suggest that both left and [[right hemisphere]]s are involved, there appears to be a clear primary role for the [[right hemisphere]], especially the right [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]].
