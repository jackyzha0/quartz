[[thoughts/henry david thoreau]] prioritized content over style, and this is why even if he was a good writer, he can be difficult to read especially in his public works (same as [[Annie Dillard]]). This is perhaps an intentional choice. He didn't want to get lost in the technicalities of skillful writing ([[The technicalities of your craft could cloud your real purpose]]). He was focused on the truth, the quality of the children of his mind, and most importantly, living itself.

When he said that he wanted to be a writer, the kind of writing he was referring to was primarily writing in his journal, that is, making sense of his thoughts and experience. This is why [[The magnum opus of Thoreau is his journal]].

His focus on content is perhaps the reason why he was never really a good poet. His poetry is subtly felt in the curiosity and joy present in his most private writings.

I take inspiration from Thoreau by committing that [[The writing I do in private is my most important writing]].

**To do**
- Question: Even if Thoreau prioritized content over style, why did he still try to infuse poetry in his writing? How did he develop his writing prowess?
