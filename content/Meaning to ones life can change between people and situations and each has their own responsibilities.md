## Meaning to ones life can change between people and situations and each has their own responsibilities # 

The answer to the question of the meaning to life is a tough one because the meaning of life differs from person to person, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person’s life at a given moment. To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: “Tell me, Master, what is the best move in the world?” There simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from a particular situation in a game and the particular personality of one’s opponent.

The same holds for human existence. One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has their own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein they cannot be replaced, nor can their life be repeated. Thus, everyone’s task is as unique as is their specific opportunity to implement it. As each situation in life represents a challenge to someone and presents a problem for them to solve, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, we should not ask what the meaning of out life is, but rather we must recognize that it is us who is asked. In a word, each individual is questioned by life; and they can only answer to life by answering for their own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, [[logotherapy]] sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.
