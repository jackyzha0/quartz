I don’t like talking in the chat about the non-solving stuff _as_ im figuring it all out. I inevitably say stupid shit that I definitely won’t agree with later. I want to come off as if I really know what I’m taking about. I’ll be more convincing. Idk how to talk about this stuff in here yet either. I don’t know what to say and when to say it. Also, how can I say I know there’s something to all this when I don’t even understand it all
