## Logical positivism # 

Logical positivism is a movement whose central thesis is [[verificationism]]. This theory of knowledge asserted that only statements verifiable through direct observation or [[Deductive reasoning|logical proof]] are meaningful in terms of conveying truth value, information or factual content.Flourishing in several European centres through the 1930s, the movement sought to prevent confusion rooted in unclear language and unverifiable claims by converting philosophy into "scientific philosophy", which, according to the logical positivists, ought to share the bases and structures of empirical sciences' best examples.
