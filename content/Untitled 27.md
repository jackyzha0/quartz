[[Psychedelic]]s may be used to change all sorts of behaviors, not just [[addiction]]. The key is their power to occasion a sufficiently dramatic experience to dope-slap people out of their story. It’s literally a reboot of the system—a biological control-alt-delete. [[Psychedelic]]s open a window of mental flexibility in which people can let go of the mental models we use to organize reality.

The most important of such model is [[identity view]], which a high-dose [[psychedelic]] experience temporarily dissolves by queting the [[default mode network]]. We have an [[addiction]] to a pattern of thinking with the self at the center of it. This underlying [[addiction]] to a pattern of thinking, or cognitive style, links the [[Addiction|addict]] to the [[depression|depressive]] and to the cancer patient obsessed with death or recurrence. 

[[Psychedelic]]s knock the legs out from under that model. That can be dangerous in the wrong circumstances, leading to bad trips and worse. But in the right setting, where your safety is assured, it may be a good intervention for dealing with some of the problems of the self—of which [[addiction]] is only one. Dying, [[depression]], obsession, eating disorders—all are exacerbated by the tyranny of an [[ego]] and the fixed narratives it constructs about our relationship to the world. By temporarily overturning that tyranny and throwing our minds into an unusually plastic [[high-entropy state]], [[psychedelic]]s, with the help of a good therapist, give us an opportunity to propose some new, more constructive stories about the self and its relationship to the world, stories that just might stick.
