I am adopting [[Andy Matuschak]]'s taxonomy in his [[Evergreen note-taking system]] with several changes, of course.

When I [[Use a note-writing system]], the ultimate goal is to write [[Evergreens]]. Thus, the most important notes in my system go up a ladder to evolve into permanent notes. However, to maintain organization, several notes that don't go up this ladder are also necessary. I divide my taxonomy of notes between notes that go up the ladder and those that don’t.

## Ladder

- Entries in my [[Diary]]. [[A diary should be used as an inbox]] where a single diary entry could be a source of several [[Fleeting notes]].
- [[Fleeting notes]] (i.e., prompts and incomplete notes) in my [[writing inbox]]. These notes accumulate over time but are drained through a [[Spaced repetition writing system]]. Well-developed fleeting notes leave the writing inbox as [[Evergreens]].
- [[Evergreens]]. While these notes leave the writing inbox in better quality, they can still be developed further. There are different kinds of permanent notes:
   - Stubs that don’t have a content of their own but gain meaning through backlinks. An example of this is the note [[Unfruitful]]. I actually gave a short description of the stub, but its meaning makes more sense because of the backlinks under it. It is a place to hold unfruitful writing prompts in my writing inbox that needs to be reviewed in a later date.
   - Simple definitions for other people’s terms of art
      - Under this category are also bridge notes, which are meant to connect the relationship between my own terms of art and the terminology of others ([[Create your own terms of art]]; [[Use bridge notes to connect your terms of art with existing ones]]).
   - Notes with precise declarative or imperative phrases with strong claims, e.g., [[Use a note-writing system]]. If I have no strong claim, I frame these notes as questions, e.g. [[thoughts/i want my audience to feel existential]] These atomic notes are the cream of the crop.
   - Higher-level permanent notes
      - Notes that abstract from multiple notes
      - My own terms of art, e.g. [[Talahardin]]
- [[Outline notes]], e.g., [[Zettelkasten]]

## Non-ladder

- Proper noun notes. These notes are not concept-oriented so they cannot be used to build permanent notes.
   - [[literature notes]]. These notes are where I collect fleeting notes from what I read. After I convert these fleeting notes into permanent notes ([[how to convert literature notes to permanent notes]]) thus emptying them, they serve as nodes for backlinks to permanent notes. Literature notes are like outline notes of other people's ideas. For example: [[_notes/02 Talahardin/How to Take Smart Notes - Ahrens]]
   - [[Person notes]] (e.g., [[contacts/rem tanauan]]) or entity notes.
   - Log notes. These notes contain ephemeral observations about a specific practice, system, or project over time. Unlike the [[Diary]], which is sliced by date, log notes are sliced by a topic of interest, e.g., [[Nature journal]].

TODO

- Write a note for each note type.
- Determine if you need to create your own terms of art for each note type.
- Information in [[Three types of notes in Zettelkasten]] might be redundant. Integrate the two notes.
