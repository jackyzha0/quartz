## Highlights
- “If you think it Operations has nothing to learn from Plant Operations, you’re wrong. Dead wrong,” he says. “Your job as vp of it Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure it service.” ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1388))
- “Likewise,” I say emphatically. I look at my watch. It’s 1:20 p.m. It’s time to head ([Location 2423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2423))
- The Goal by Dr. Eli Goldratt. ([Location 2603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2603))
- “Sensei Goldratt taught us that in most plants, there are a very small number of resources, whether it’s men, machines, or materials, that dictates the output of the entire system. We call this the constraint—or bottleneck. Either term works. Whatever you call it, until you create a trusted system to manage the flow of work to the constraint, the constraint is constantly wasted, which means that the constraint is likely being drastically underutilized. ([Location 2605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2605))
- “That means you’re not delivering to the business the full capacity available to you. It also likely means that you’re not paying down technical debt, so your problems and amount of unplanned work continues to increase over time,” he says. He continues, “You’ve identified this Brent person as a constraint to restore service. Trust me, you’ll find that he constrains many other important flows of work, as well.” ([Location 2608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2608))
- “There are five focusing steps which Sensei Goldratt describes in The Goal: Step 1 is to identify the constraint. You’ve done that, so congratulations. Keep challenging yourself to really make sure that’s your organizational constraint, because if you’re wrong, nothing you do will matter. Remember, any improvement not made at the constraint is just an illusion, yes? ([Location 2612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2612))
- “Step 2 is to exploit the constraint,” he continues. “In other words, make sure that the constraint is not allowed to waste any time. Ever. It should never be waiting on any other resource for anything, and it should always be working on the highest priority commitment the it Operations organization has made to the rest of the enterprise. Always.” I hear him say encouragingly, “You’ve done a good job exploiting the constraint on several fronts. ([Location 2615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2615))
- unplanned work kills your ability to do planned work, so you must always do whatever it takes to eradicate it. ([Location 2621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2621))

- Step 3, which is to subordinate the constraint. In the Theory of Constraints, this is typically implemented by something called Drum-Buffer-Rope. In The Goal, the main character, Alex, learns about this when he discovers that Herbie, the slowest Boy Scout in the troop, actually dictates the entire group’s marching pace. Alex moved Herbie to the front of the line to prevent kids from going on too far ahead. Later at Alex’s plant, he started to release all work in accordance to the rate it could be consumed by the heat treat ovens, which was his plant’s bottleneck. That was his real-life Herbie.” ([Location 2623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2623))
- Remember, it goes beyond reducing wip. Being able to take needless work out of the system is more important than being able to put more work into the system. ([Location 2647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2647))

- great team doesn’t mean that they had the smartest people. What made those teams great is that everyone trusted one another. It can be a powerful thing when that magic dynamic exists. ([Location 2907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2907))

- ‘technical debt’ that is not being paid down. It comes from taking shortcuts, which may make sense in the short-term. But like financial debt, the compounding interest costs grow over time.

- “You’ve got to stop thinking like a work center supervisor. You need to think bigger, like a plant manager.

- Dev and Ops working together, along with qa and the business, are a super-tribe that can achieve amazing things. They also knew that until code is in production, no value is actually being generated, because it’s merely wip stuck in the system. He kept reducing the batch size, enabling fast feature flow. In part, he did this by ensuring environments were always available when they were needed. He automated the build and deployment process, recognizing that infrastructure could be treated as code, just like the application that Development ships.

- The mission at hand is how we can elevate their productivity so that they’re as productive as the high performers. We know through more than four years of State of DevOps Reports conducted by Puppet that high perfomers are two to three orders of magnitude more productive than their peers. In my mind, helping everyone reach this level of high performace will create trillions of dollars of economic value per year and is where the next surge of productivity will come from.

## Highlights
- “If you think it Operations has nothing to learn from Plant Operations, you’re wrong. Dead wrong,” he says. “Your job as vp of it Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure it service.” ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1388))
- “Likewise,” I say emphatically. I look at my watch. It’s 1:20 p.m. It’s time to head ([Location 2423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2423))
- The Goal by Dr. Eli Goldratt. ([Location 2603](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2603))
- “Sensei Goldratt taught us that in most plants, there are a very small number of resources, whether it’s men, machines, or materials, that dictates the output of the entire system. We call this the constraint—or bottleneck. Either term works. Whatever you call it, until you create a trusted system to manage the flow of work to the constraint, the constraint is constantly wasted, which means that the constraint is likely being drastically underutilized. ([Location 2605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2605))
- “That means you’re not delivering to the business the full capacity available to you. It also likely means that you’re not paying down technical debt, so your problems and amount of unplanned work continues to increase over time,” he says. He continues, “You’ve identified this Brent person as a constraint to restore service. Trust me, you’ll find that he constrains many other important flows of work, as well.” ([Location 2608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2608))
- “There are five focusing steps which Sensei Goldratt describes in The Goal: Step 1 is to identify the constraint. You’ve done that, so congratulations. Keep challenging yourself to really make sure that’s your organizational constraint, because if you’re wrong, nothing you do will matter. Remember, any improvement not made at the constraint is just an illusion, yes? ([Location 2612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2612))
- “Step 2 is to exploit the constraint,” he continues. “In other words, make sure that the constraint is not allowed to waste any time. Ever. It should never be waiting on any other resource for anything, and it should always be working on the highest priority commitment the it Operations organization has made to the rest of the enterprise. Always.” I hear him say encouragingly, “You’ve done a good job exploiting the constraint on several fronts. ([Location 2615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2615))

In The Goal, the main character, Alex, learns about this when he discovers that Herbie, the slowest Boy Scout in the troop, actually dictates the entire group’s marching pace. Alex moved Herbie to the front of the line to prevent kids from going on too far ahead. Later at Alex’s plant, he started to release all work in accordance to the rate it could be consumed by the heat treat ovens, which was his plant’s bottleneck. That was his real-life Herbie.” ([Location 2623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2623))
