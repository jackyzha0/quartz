## Highlights
- The voice comes braying in as soon as we open our eyes in the morning, and then heckles us all day long with an air horn. It’s a fever swamp of urges, desires, and judgments. It’s fixated on the past and the future, to the detriment of the here and now. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=68))
- Our entire lives, he argued, are governed by a voice in our heads. This voice is engaged in a ceaseless stream of thinking—most of it negative, repetitive, and self-referential. It squawks away at us from the minute we open our eyes in the morning until the minute we fall asleep at night, if it allows us to sleep at all. Talk, talk, talk: the voice is constantly judging and labeling everything in its field of vision. Its targets aren’t just external; it often viciously taunts us, too. ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=979))
- The ego is never satisfied. No matter how much stuff we buy, no matter how many arguments we win or delicious meals we consume, the ego never feels complete. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=998))
- The ego is constantly comparing itself to others. It has us measuring our self-worth against the looks, wealth, and social status of everyone else. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1000))
- The ego thrives on drama. It keeps our old resentments and grievances alive through compulsive thought. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1002))
- Perhaps the most powerful Tollean insight into the ego was that it is obsessed with the past and the future, at the expense of the present. We “live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation,” ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1003))
- “When you have one foot in the future and the other in the past, you piss on the present.” ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1009))
- in the deadline-dominated world of news, I was always hurtling headlong through the day, checking things off my to-do list, constantly picturing completion instead of calmly and carefully enjoying the process. The unspoken assumption behind most of my forward momentum was that whatever was coming next would definitely be better. Only when I reached that ineffable … whatever … would I be totally satisfied. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1010))
- “Make the present moment your friend rather than your enemy. Because many people live habitually as if the present moment were an obstacle that they need to overcome in order to get to the next moment. And imagine living your whole life like that, where always this moment is never quite right, not good enough because you need to get to the next one. That is continuous stress.” ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1171))
- The route to true happiness, he argued, was to achieve a visceral understanding of impermanence, which would take you off the emotional roller coaster and allow you to see your dramas and desires through a wider lens. ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1503))
- In a nutshell, mindfulness is the ability to recognize what is happening in your mind right now—anger, jealousy, sadness, the pain of a stubbed toe, whatever—without getting carried away by it. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1719))
- According to the Buddha, we have three habitual responses to everything we experience. We want it, reject it, or we zone out. Cookies: I want. Mosquitoes: I reject. The safety instructions the flight attendants read aloud on an airplane: I zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth option, a way to view the contents of our mind with nonjudgmental remove. I found this theory elegant, but utterly unfeasible. ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1721))
- Our minds have this other capability—a bonus level, to put it in gamerspeak—that no one ever tells us about in school. (Not here in the West, at least.) We can do more than just think; we also have the power simply to be aware of things—without judgment, without the ego. This is not to denigrate thinking, just to say that thinking without awareness can be a harsh master. ([Location 1743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1743))
- “People come to me a lot feeling like they ought to be loving themselves, and I actually counsel against it,” he said. His delivery was off-the-cuff and shtick-free. In stark contrast to Brach, he argued that we needed to actively get in touch with our ugly side. “Mindfulness gives us a way to examine our self-hatred without trying to make it go away, without trying to love it particularly.” Just being mindful of it, he said, could be “tremendously liberating.” ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1851))
- Seeing a problem clearly does not prevent you from taking action, he explained. Acceptance is not passivity. Sometimes we are justifiably displeased. What mindfulness does is create some space in your head so you can, as the Buddhists say, “respond” rather than simply “react.” In the Buddhist view, you can’t control what comes up in your head; it all arises out of a mysterious void. We spend a lot of time judging ourselves harshly for feelings that we had no role in summoning. The only thing you can control is how you handle it. ([Location 1909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1909))
- He’s talking about a verse where the Buddha calls everything we experience—sights, sounds, smells, etc.—the “terrible bait of the world.” “It’s … an amazing statement,” he says. “Moment after moment, experiences are arising, and it’s as if each one has a hook … and we’re the fish. Do we bite? Or do we not bite, and just swim freely in the ocean?” ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2173))
- After an initial period of “how dare he” indignation over Jim Murphy telling me I was never going to be a big-time anchorman, I decided to approach the problem in a Buddhist style: to lean into it, to take his views seriously, no matter how inconvenient they may have been—to respond, rather than react. ([Location 2607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2607))
- This, as Joseph had pointed out on retreat, is the lie we tell ourselves our whole lives: as soon as we get the next meal, party, vacation, sexual encounter, as soon as we get married, get a promotion, get to the airport check-in, get through security and consume a bouquet of Auntie Anne’s Cinnamon Sugar Stix, we’ll feel really good. But as soon as we find ourselves in the airport gate area, having ingested 470 calories’ worth of sugar and fat before dinner, we ([Location 2726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2726))
- “It’s not me telling you,” she said. “It’s neuroscience that would say that our capacity to multitask is virtually nonexistent. Multitasking is a computer-derived term. We have one processor. We can’t do it.” ([Location 2827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2827))

- This problem was, of course, exacerbated in the age of what had been dubbed the “infoblitzkrieg,” where it took superhuman strength to ignore the siren call of the latest tweet, or the blinking red light on the BlackBerry. Scientists had even come up with a term for this condition: “continuous partial attention.” It was a syndrome with which I was intimately familiar, even after all my meditating. ([Location 2833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2833))
- Another tip: take short mindfulness breaks throughout the day. She called them “purposeful pauses.” So, for example, instead of fidgeting or tapping your fingers while your computer boots up, try to watch your breath for a few minutes. ([Location 2838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2838))

- I had long assumed that ceaseless planning was the recipe for effectiveness, but Marturano’s point was that too much mental churning was counterproductive. When you lurch from one thing to the next, constantly scheming, or reacting to incoming fire, the mind gets exhausted. You get sloppy and make bad decisions. I could see how the counterintuitive act of stopping, even for a few seconds, could be a source of strength, not weakness. This was a practical complement to Joseph’s “is this useful?” mantra. It was the opposite of zoning out, ([Location 2845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2845))
- Studies showed that the best way to engineer an epiphany was to work hard, focus, research, and think about a problem—and then let go. Do something else. That didn’t necessarily mean meditate, but do something that relaxes and distracts you; let your unconscious mind go to work, making connections from disparate parts of the brain. ([Location 2850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2850))
- there is a self-interested, or selfish, case for being compassionate?” “Yes. Practice of compassion is ultimately benefit to you. So I usually describe: we are selfish, but be wise selfish rather than foolish selfish.” ([Location 2984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2984))
- if I was really interested in Buddhism, I should read his favorite book, by an ancient sage named Shantideva. ([Location 2990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2990))
- Research also showed that everyone from the elderly to alcoholics to people living with AIDS patients saw their health improve if they did volunteer work. Overall, compassionate people tended to be healthier, happier, more popular, and more successful at work. ([Location 3001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3001))
- had fallen, he said, into several classic “pitfalls of the path.” People often misinterpreted the dharma to mean they had to adopt a sort of meekness. ([Location 3262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3262))
- Another pitfall was detachment. I thought I was being mindful of my distress when I was left out of the big stories, but really I was just building a wall to keep out the things that made me angry or fearful. The final pitfall to which I’d succumbed was nihilism: an occasional sense of, “Whatever, man, everything’s impermanent.” ([Location 3266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3266))
- “Praise Allah, but also tie your camel to the post.” In other words, it’s good to take a transcendent view of the world, but don’t be a chump. ([Location 3271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3271))
- “The answer is in nonattachment,” he said. In my defense, the term was deceptively bland. “It’s nonattachment to the results. I think for an ambitious person who cares about their career—who wants to create things and be successful—it’s natural to be trying really hard. ([Location 3347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3347))
- I couldn’t quite figure out how you could work your tail off on something and then not be attached to the outcome. I had come up through a system that venerated bootstrapping and a fierce refusal to fail. Doing this without attachment didn’t seem to fit the paradigm. ([Location 3351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3351))
- again. I said, “When we last spoke, you said it’s okay to be ambitious, but don’t be attached to the results. I cut you off, as I usually do—but what does that mean?” “It’s like, you write a book, you want it to be well received, you want it to be at the top of the bestsellers list, but you have limited control over what happens. You can hire a publicist, you can do every interview, you can be prepared, but you have very little control over the marketplace. So you put it out there without attachment, so it has its own life. Everything is like that.” ([Location 3354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3354))
- Striving is fine, as long as it’s tempered by the realization that, in an entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control. If you don’t waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome—so that if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off, and get back in the fray. That, to use a loaded term, is enlightened self-interest. ([Location 3364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3364))
- didn’t need to waste so much time envisioning some vague horribleness awaiting me in my future. ([Location 3373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3373))
- All I had to do was tell myself: if it doesn’t work, I only need the grit to start again—just like when my mind wandered in meditation. ([Location 3374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3374))
- “nonattachment to results” was my long-sought Holy Grail, the middle path, the marriage of “the price of security” and “the wisdom of insecurity.” ([Location 3376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3376))
- compassion has the strategic benefit of winning you allies. ([Location 3397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3397))
- Sometimes you need to compete aggressively, plead your own case, or even have a sharp word with someone. It’s not easy, but it’s possible to do this calmly and without making the whole thing overly personal. ([Location 3401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3401))
- Meditation is the superpower that makes all the other precepts possible. The practice has countless benefits—from better health to increased focus to a deeper sense of calm—but the biggie is the ability to respond instead of react to your impulses and urges. We live our life propelled by desire and aversion. In meditation, instead of succumbing to these deeply rooted habits of mind, you are simply watching what comes up in your head nonjudgmentally. ([Location 3403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3403))

- People trained in self-compassion meditation are more likely to quit smoking and stick to a diet. They are better able to bounce back from missteps. ([Location 3436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3436))
- All successful people fail. If you can create an inner environment where your mistakes are forgiven and flaws are candidly confronted, your resilience expands exponentially. ([Location 3437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3437))
- He explained that the brain is a pleasure-seeking machine. Once you teach it, through meditation, that abiding calmly in the present moment feels better than our habitual state of clinging, over time, the brain will want more and more mindfulness. He compared it to lab rats that learn to avoid an electric shock. ([Location 3480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3480))
- If you give your brain enough of a taste of mindfulness, it will eventually create a self-reinforcing spiral—a retreat from greed and hatred that could, Jud insisted, potentially lead all the way to the definitive uprooting of negative emotions (in other words, enlightenment). ([Location 3484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3484))
- struck me that the voice in my head is still, in many ways, an asshole. However, mindfulness now does a pretty good job of tying up the voice and putting duct tape over its mouth. ([Location 3546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3546))
- And while I still worry about work, learning to “care and not to care,” at least 10% of the time, has freed me up to focus more on the parts of the job that matter most— ([Location 3551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3551))

- Buddhism Without Beliefs, Stephen Batchelor ([Location 3640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3640))
- Under the sway of the ego, life becomes a constant low-grade crisis. You are never sated, never satisfied, always reaching for the next thing, like a colicky baby. Meditation is the antidote. ([Location 3757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3757))

- had fallen, he said, into several classic “pitfalls of the path.” People often misinterpreted the dharma to mean they had to adopt a sort of meekness. ([Location 3262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3262))
- Another pitfall was detachment. I thought I was being mindful of my distress when I was left out of the big stories, but really I was just building a wall to keep out the things that made me angry or fearful. The final pitfall to which I’d succumbed was nihilism: an occasional sense of, “Whatever, man, everything’s impermanent.” ([Location 3266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3266))
- “Praise Allah, but also tie your camel to the post.” In other words, it’s good to take a transcendent view of the world, but don’t be a chump. ([Location 3271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3271))
- “The answer is in nonattachment,” he said. In my defense, the term was deceptively bland. “It’s nonattachment to the results. I think for an ambitious person who cares about their career—who wants to create things and be successful—it’s natural to be trying really hard. ([Location 3347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3347))
- I couldn’t quite figure out how you could work your tail off on something and then not be attached to the outcome. I had come up through a system that venerated bootstrapping and a fierce refusal to fail. Doing this without attachment didn’t seem to fit the paradigm. ([Location 3351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3351))
- again. I said, “When we last spoke, you said it’s okay to be ambitious, but don’t be attached to the results. I cut you off, as I usually do—but what does that mean?” “It’s like, you write a book, you want it to be well received, you want it to be at the top of the bestsellers list, but you have limited control over what happens. You can hire a publicist, you can do every interview, you can be prepared, but you have very little control over the marketplace. So you put it out there without attachment, so it has its own life. Everything is like that.” ([Location 3354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3354))
- Striving is fine, as long as it’s tempered by the realization that, in an entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control. If you don’t waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome—so that if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off, and get back in the fray. That, to use a loaded term, is enlightened self-interest. ([Location 3364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3364))

- “nonattachment to results” was my long-sought Holy Grail, the middle path, the marriage of “the price of security” and “the wisdom of insecurity.” ([Location 3376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3376))

It’s not easy, but it’s possible to do this calmly and without making the whole thing overly personal. ([Location 3401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3401))
- Meditation is the superpower that makes all the other precepts possible. The practice has countless benefits—from better health to increased focus to a deeper sense of calm—but the biggie is the ability to respond instead of react to your impulses and urges. We live our life propelled by desire and aversion. In meditation, instead of succumbing to these deeply rooted habits of mind, you are simply watching what comes up in your head nonjudgmentally.

## Highlights
- The voice comes braying in as soon as we open our eyes in the morning, and then heckles us all day long with an air horn. It’s a fever swamp of urges, desires, and judgments. It’s fixated on the past and the future, to the detriment of the here and now. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=68))
- Our entire lives, he argued, are governed by a voice in our heads. This voice is engaged in a ceaseless stream of thinking—most of it negative, repetitive, and self-referential. It squawks away at us from the minute we open our eyes in the morning until the minute we fall asleep at night, if it allows us to sleep at all. Talk, talk, talk: the voice is constantly judging and labeling everything in its field of vision. Its targets aren’t just external; it often viciously taunts us, too. ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=979))
- The ego is never satisfied. No matter how much stuff we buy, no matter how many arguments we win or delicious meals we consume, the ego never feels complete. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=998))
- The ego is constantly comparing itself to others. It has us measuring our self-worth against the looks, wealth, and social status of everyone else. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1000))
- The ego thrives on drama. It keeps our old resentments and grievances alive through compulsive thought. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1002))
- Perhaps the most powerful Tollean insight into the ego was that it is obsessed with the past and the future, at the expense of the present. We “live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation,” ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1003))
- “When you have one foot in the future and the other in the past, you piss on the present.” ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1009))
- in the deadline-dominated world of news, I was always hurtling headlong through the day, checking things off my to-do list, constantly picturing completion instead of calmly and carefully enjoying the process. The unspoken assumption behind most of my forward momentum was that whatever was coming next would definitely be better. Only when I reached that ineffable … whatever … would I be totally satisfied. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1010))
- “Make the present moment your friend rather than your enemy. Because many people live habitually as if the present moment were an obstacle that they need to overcome in order to get to the next moment. And imagine living your whole life like that, where always this moment is never quite right, not good enough because you need to get to the next one. That is continuous stress.” ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1171))
- The route to true happiness, he argued, was to achieve a visceral understanding of impermanence, which would take you off the emotional roller coaster and allow you to see your dramas and desires through a wider lens. ([Location 1503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1503))
- In a nutshell, mindfulness is the ability to recognize what is happening in your mind right now—anger, jealousy, sadness, the pain of a stubbed toe, whatever—without getting carried away by it. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1719))
- According to the Buddha, we have three habitual responses to everything we experience. We want it, reject it, or we zone out. Cookies: I want. Mosquitoes: I reject. The safety instructions the flight attendants read aloud on an airplane: I zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth option, a way to view the contents of our mind with nonjudgmental remove. I found this theory elegant, but utterly unfeasible. ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1721))
- Our minds have this other capability—a bonus level, to put it in gamerspeak—that no one ever tells us about in school. (Not here in the West, at least.) We can do more than just think; we also have the power simply to be aware of things—without judgment, without the ego. This is not to denigrate thinking, just to say that thinking without awareness can be a harsh master. ([Location 1743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1743))
- “People come to me a lot feeling like they ought to be loving themselves, and I actually counsel against it,” he said. His delivery was off-the-cuff and shtick-free. In stark contrast to Brach, he argued that we needed to actively get in touch with our ugly side. “Mindfulness gives us a way to examine our self-hatred without trying to make it go away, without trying to love it particularly.” Just being mindful of it, he said, could be “tremendously liberating.” ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1851))
- Seeing a problem clearly does not prevent you from taking action, he explained. Acceptance is not passivity. Sometimes we are justifiably displeased. What mindfulness does is create some space in your head so you can, as the Buddhists say, “respond” rather than simply “react.” In the Buddhist view, you can’t control what comes up in your head; it all arises out of a mysterious void. We spend a lot of time judging ourselves harshly for feelings that we had no role in summoning. The only thing you can control is how you handle it. ([Location 1909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1909))
- He’s talking about a verse where the Buddha calls everything we experience—sights, sounds, smells, etc.—the “terrible bait of the world.” “It’s … an amazing statement,” he says. “Moment after moment, experiences are arising, and it’s as if each one has a hook … and we’re the fish. Do we bite? Or do we not bite, and just swim freely in the ocean?” ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2173))
- After an initial period of “how dare he” indignation over Jim Murphy telling me I was never going to be a big-time anchorman, I decided to approach the problem in a Buddhist style: to lean into it, to take his views seriously, no matter how inconvenient they may have been—to respond, rather than react. ([Location 2607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2607))
- This, as Joseph had pointed out on retreat, is the lie we tell ourselves our whole lives: as soon as we get the next meal, party, vacation, sexual encounter, as soon as we get married, get a promotion, get to the airport check-in, get through security and consume a bouquet of Auntie Anne’s Cinnamon Sugar Stix, we’ll feel really good. But as soon as we find ourselves in the airport gate area, having ingested 470 calories’ worth of sugar and fat before dinner, we ([Location 2726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2726))
- “It’s not me telling you,” she said. “It’s neuroscience that would say that our capacity to multitask is virtually nonexistent. Multitasking is a computer-derived term. We have one processor. We can’t do it.” ([Location 2827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2827))

- This problem was, of course, exacerbated in the age of what had been dubbed the “infoblitzkrieg,” where it took superhuman strength to ignore the siren call of the latest tweet, or the blinking red light on the BlackBerry. Scientists had even come up with a term for this condition: “continuous partial attention.” It was a syndrome with which I was intimately familiar, even after all my meditating. ([Location 2833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2833))
- Another tip: take short mindfulness breaks throughout the day. She called them “purposeful pauses.” So, for example, instead of fidgeting or tapping your fingers while your computer boots up, try to watch your breath for a few minutes. ([Location 2838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2838))

- I had long assumed that ceaseless planning was the recipe for effectiveness, but Marturano’s point was that too much mental churning was counterproductive. When you lurch from one thing to the next, constantly scheming, or reacting to incoming fire, the mind gets exhausted. You get sloppy and make bad decisions. I could see how the counterintuitive act of stopping, even for a few seconds, could be a source of strength, not weakness. This was a practical complement to Joseph’s “is this useful?” mantra. It was the opposite of zoning out, ([Location 2845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2845))
- Studies showed that the best way to engineer an epiphany was to work hard, focus, research, and think about a problem—and then let go. Do something else. That didn’t necessarily mean meditate, but do something that relaxes and distracts you; let your unconscious mind go to work, making connections from disparate parts of the brain. ([Location 2850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2850))
- there is a self-interested, or selfish, case for being compassionate?” “Yes. Practice of compassion is ultimately benefit to you. So I usually describe: we are selfish, but be wise selfish rather than foolish selfish.” ([Location 2984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2984))
- if I was really interested in Buddhism, I should read his favorite book, by an ancient sage named Shantideva. ([Location 2990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2990))
- Research also showed that everyone from the elderly to alcoholics to people living with AIDS patients saw their health improve if they did volunteer work. Overall, compassionate people tended to be healthier, happier, more popular, and more successful at work. ([Location 3001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3001))

Because many people live habitually as if the present moment were an obstacle that they need to overcome in order to get to the next moment. And imagine living your whole life like that, where always this moment is never quite right, not good enough because you need to get to the next one. That is continuous stress.” ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1171))
- The route to true happiness, he argued, was to achieve a visceral understanding of impermanence, which would take you off the emotional roller coaster and allow you to see your dramas and desires through a wider lens.

- In a nutshell, mindfulness is the ability to recognize what is happening in your mind right now—anger, jealousy, sadness, the pain of a stubbed toe, whatever—without getting carried away by it. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1719))
- According to the Buddha, we have three habitual responses to everything we experience. We want it, reject it, or we zone out. Cookies: I want. Mosquitoes: I reject. The safety instructions the flight attendants read aloud on an airplane: I zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth option, a way to view the contents of our mind with nonjudgmental remove. I found this theory elegant, but utterly unfeasible. ([Location 1721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1721))
- Our minds have this other capability—a bonus level, to put it in gamerspeak—that no one ever tells us about in school. (Not here in the West, at least.) We can do more than just think; we also have the power simply to be aware of things—without judgment, without the ego. This is not to denigrate thinking, just to say that thinking without awareness can be a harsh master. ([Location 1743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1743))
- “People come to me a lot feeling like they ought to be loving themselves, and I actually counsel against it,” he said. His delivery was off-the-cuff and shtick-free. In stark contrast to Brach, he argued that we needed to actively get in touch with our ugly side. “Mindfulness gives us a way to examine our self-hatred without trying to make it go away, without trying to love it particularly.” Just being mindful of it, he said, could be “tremendously liberating.” ([Location 1851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=1851))
- Seeing a problem clearly does not prevent you from taking action, he explained. Acceptance is not passivity. Sometimes we are justifiably displeased. What mindfulness does is create some space in your head so you can, as the Buddhists say, “respond” rather than simply “react.” In the Buddhist view, you can’t control what comes up in your head; it all arises out of a mysterious void. We spend a lot of time judging ourselves harshly for feelings that we had no role in summoning. The only thing you can control is how you handle it.

- He’s talking about a verse where the Buddha calls everything we experience—sights, sounds, smells, etc.—the “terrible bait of the world.” “It’s … an amazing statement,” he says. “Moment after moment, experiences are arising, and it’s as if each one has a hook … and we’re the fish. Do we bite? Or do we not bite, and just swim freely in the ocean?” ([Location 2173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2173))
- After an initial period of “how dare he” indignation over Jim Murphy telling me I was never going to be a big-time anchorman, I decided to approach the problem in a Buddhist style: to lean into it, to take his views seriously, no matter how inconvenient they may have been—to respond, rather than react.

- This, as Joseph had pointed out on retreat, is the lie we tell ourselves our whole lives: as soon as we get the next meal, party, vacation, sexual encounter, as soon as we get married, get a promotion, get to the airport check-in, get through security and consume a bouquet of Auntie Anne’s Cinnamon Sugar Stix, we’ll feel really good. But as soon as we find ourselves in the airport gate area, having ingested 470 calories’ worth of sugar and fat before dinner, we ([Location 2726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2726))

- This problem was, of course, exacerbated in the age of what had been dubbed the “infoblitzkrieg,” where it took superhuman strength to ignore the siren call of the latest tweet, or the blinking red light on the BlackBerry. Scientists had even come up with a term for this condition: “continuous partial attention.” It was a syndrome with which I was intimately familiar, even after all my meditating.

- I had long assumed that ceaseless planning was the recipe for effectiveness, but Marturano’s point was that too much mental churning was counterproductive. When you lurch from one thing to the next, constantly scheming, or reacting to incoming fire, the mind gets exhausted. You get sloppy and make bad decisions. I could see how the counterintuitive act of stopping, even for a few seconds, could be a source of strength, not weakness. This was a practical complement to Joseph’s “is this useful?” mantra. It was the opposite of zoning out, ([Location 2845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=2845))
- Studies showed that the best way to engineer an epiphany was to work hard, focus, research, and think about a problem—and then let go. Do something else. That didn’t necessarily mean meditate, but do something that relaxes and distracts you; let your unconscious mind go to work, making connections from disparate parts of the brain.

- there is a self-interested, or selfish, case for being compassionate?” “Yes. Practice of compassion is ultimately benefit to you.

- had fallen, he said, into several classic “pitfalls of the path.” People often misinterpreted the dharma to mean they had to adopt a sort of meekness. ([Location 3262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3262))
- Another pitfall was detachment. I thought I was being mindful of my distress when I was left out of the big stories, but really I was just building a wall to keep out the things that made me angry or fearful. The final pitfall to which I’d succumbed was nihilism: an occasional sense of, “Whatever, man, everything’s impermanent.” ([Location 3266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3266))
- “Praise Allah, but also tie your camel to the post.” In other words, it’s good to take a transcendent view of the world, but don’t be a chump. ([Location 3271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3271))
- “The answer is in nonattachment,” he said. In my defense, the term was deceptively bland. “It’s nonattachment to the results. I think for an ambitious person who cares about their career—who wants to create things and be successful—it’s natural to be trying really hard.

- I couldn’t quite figure out how you could work your tail off on something and then not be attached to the outcome. I had come up through a system that venerated bootstrapping and a fierce refusal to fail. Doing this without attachment didn’t seem to fit the paradigm.

- again. I said, “When we last spoke, you said it’s okay to be ambitious, but don’t be attached to the results. I cut you off, as I usually do—but what does that mean?” “It’s like, you write a book, you want it to be well received, you want it to be at the top of the bestsellers list, but you have limited control over what happens. You can hire a publicist, you can do every interview, you can be prepared, but you have very little control over the marketplace. So you put it out there without attachment, so it has its own life. Everything is like that.” ([Location 3354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3354))
- Striving is fine, as long as it’s tempered by the realization that, in an entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control. If you don’t waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome—so that if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off, and get back in the fray. That, to use a loaded term, is enlightened self-interest. ([Location 3364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KFHBNA4&location=3364))

- Meditation is the superpower that makes all the other precepts possible. The practice has countless benefits—from better health to increased focus to a deeper sense of calm—but the biggie is the ability to respond instead of react to your impulses and urges. We live our life propelled by desire and aversion. In meditation, instead of succumbing to these deeply rooted habits of mind, you are simply watching what comes up in your head nonjudgmentally.

- He explained that the brain is a pleasure-seeking machine.
