## Highlights
- We are very good at preparing to live, but not very good at living. We know how to sacrifice ten years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get a job, a car, a house, and so on. But we have difficulty remembering that we are alive in the present moment, the only moment there is for us to be alive. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=187))
- Yet even a smile like that is enough to relax all the muscles in our face, to banish all worries and fatigue. A tiny bud of a smile on our lips nourishes awareness and calms us miraculously. It returns to us the peace we thought we had lost. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=206))
- Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile. Dwelling in the present moment, I know this is a wonderful moment! ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=236))
- According to the method of conscious breathing, when we breathe in and out, we stop thinking, because saying “In” and “Out” is not thinking—“In” and “Out” are only words to help us concentrate on our breathing. If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=257))
- Watching a bad TV program, we become the TV program. We are what we feel and perceive. If we are angry, we are the anger. If we are in love, we are love. If we look at a snow-covered mountain peak, we are the mountain. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=275))
- You can use any sound to remind you to pause, breathe in and out, and enjoy the present moment. The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=342))
- When I was four years old, my mother used to bring me a cookie every time she came home from the market. I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=347))
- Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation. We can eat in a way that we restore the cookie of our childhood. The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=354))
- We each looked at our tangerine, and the children were invited to meditate on its origins. They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=360))
- In our daily lives, we may see the people around us, but if we lack mindfulness, they are just phantoms, not real people, and we ourselves are also ghosts. Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=371))
- “The purpose of eating breakfast is to eat breakfast.” ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=379))
- Eating a meal in mindfulness is an important practice. We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times. We can recover ourselves completely after three breaths like this. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=380))
- we look at each person as we breathe in and out in order to be in touch with ourselves and everyone at the table. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=383))
- After breathing, we smile. Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=386))
- After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=389))
- Having the opportunity to sit with our family and friends and enjoy wonderful food is something precious, something not everyone has. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=393))
- the idea that doing dishes is unpleasant can occur only when you aren’t doing them. Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle. The dishes themselves and the fact that I am here washing them are miracles! ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=414))
- Washing the dishes is at the same time a means and an end—that is, not only do we do the dishes in order to have clean dishes, we also do the dishes just to do the dishes, to live fully in each moment while washing them. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=423))
- We feel that there is a vacuum in us and we don’t want to confront it. We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape. Either we turn on the television, pick up the telephone, read a novel, go out with a friend, or take the car and go somewhere. Our civilization teaches us to act this way and provides us with many things we can use to lose touch with ourselves. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=474))

- When you practice half an hour of sitting meditation a day, that time should be for all twenty-four hours, and not just for that half-hour. One smile, one breath, should be for the benefit of the whole day, not just for that moment. We must practice in a way that removes the barrier between practice and non-practice. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=510))
- We should be able to bring the practice from the meditation hall into our daily lives. We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=516))
- The foundation of happiness is mindfulness. The basic condition for being happy is our consciousness of being happy. If we are not aware that we are happy, we are not really happy. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=548))
- When we have a toothache, we know that not having a toothache is a wonderful thing. But when we do not have a toothache, we are still not happy. A non-toothache is very pleasant. There are so many things that are enjoyable, but when we don’t practice mindfulness, we don’t appreciate them. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=549))
- If you can refrain from hoping, you can bring yourself entirely into the present moment and discover the joy that is already here. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=579))
- Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from hope may create a strong reaction. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=583))
- One day the Buddha held up a flower in front of an audience of 1,250 monks and nuns. He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=595))
- When we have an unpleasant feeling, we may want to chase it away. But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=662))
- Mindful observation is based on the principle of “non-duality”: our feeling is not separate from us or caused merely by something outside us; our feeling is us, and for the moment we are that feeling. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=667))
- Our attitude of not clinging to or rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting go, an important part of meditation practice. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=669))
- A teacher has to give birth to the teacher within his student, and a psychotherapist has to give birth to the psychotherapist within his patient. The patient’s “internal psychotherapist” can then work full-time in a very effective way. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=712))
- After recognizing the feeling, becoming one with it, calming it down, and releasing it, we can look deeply into its causes, which are often based on inaccurate perceptions. As soon as we understand the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=717))

- “Breathing in, I know that anger is in me. Breathing out, I know that I am my anger.” If we follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger, it can no longer monopolize our consciousness. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=725))
- Like a fireman, we have to pour water on the blaze first and not waste time looking for the one who set the house on fire. “Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=734))
- When we are angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=737))
- Breathing in, I know that anger is here. Breathing out, I know that the anger is me. Breathing in, I know that anger is unpleasant. Breathing out, I know this feeling will pass. Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out, I am strong enough to take care of this anger. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=767))
- If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding, clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=778))
- If we do not untie our knots when they form, they will grow tighter and stronger. Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=812))
- When we live with another person, to protect each other’s happiness, we should help one another transform the internal formations that we produce together. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=837))
- Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=839))
- In Buddhism, the word “suchness” is used to mean “the essence or particular characteristics of a thing or a person, its true nature.” Each person has his or her suchness. If we want to live in peace and happiness with a person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully and happily together. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=848))
- When we bring natural gas into our homes for heating and cooking, we know the suchness of gas. We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well. ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=851))
- Before he left Vietnam forty years ago, his mother held his hand and told him, “Whenever you miss me, look into your hand, and you will see me immediately.” ([Location 859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=859))
- But I believe that the parents did not mean to plant those seeds. They did not intend to make their children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds, and their father and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=871))
- When we look at our parents with compassion, often we see that our parents are only victims who never had the chance to practice mindfulness. They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all identity with our parents. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=889))
- Every time a seed has an occasion to manifest itself, it produces new seeds of the same kind. If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=903))
- We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=943))
- Life is filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby. Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we have asthma to enjoy our breathing. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=947))
- Awareness of the precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=950))
- When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don’t blame the lettuce. You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=955))
- Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=958))
- When you understand, you cannot help but love. You cannot get angry. To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living beings with the eyes of compassion. When you understand, you cannot help but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=971))
- When we are in contact with another’s suffering, a feeling of compassion is born in us. Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.” ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=992))
- We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know that he is also a victim. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1007))
- So when you hug your child, your friend, your spouse, I recommend that you first breathe in and out consciously and return to the present moment. Then, while you hold him or her in your arms, breathe three times consciously, and you will enjoy your hugging more than ever before. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1033))
- If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1095))
- Real strength is not in power, money, or weapons, but in deep, inner peace. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1150))
- When we sit down to dinner and look at our plate filled with fragrant and appetizing food, we can nourish our awareness of the bitter pain of people who suffer from hunger. ([Location 1252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1252))

- Before each meal, we can join our palms in mindfulness and think about the children who do not have enough to eat. Doing so will help us maintain mindfulness of our good fortune, and perhaps one day we will find ways to do something to help change the system of injustice that exists in the world. ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1259))
- If we cannot smile, we cannot help other people smile. If we are not peaceful, then we cannot contribute to the peace movement. ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1273))
- Meditation is to look deeply into things and to see how we can change ourselves and how we can transform our situation. To transform our situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation. ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1287))
- During any conflict, we need people who can understand the suffering of all sides. For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other sides, that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the situation. This applies to problems of the family as well as to problems of society. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1322))
- “I am sorry, I hurt you out of my ignorance, out of my lack of mindfulness, out of my lack of skillfulness. I will try my best to change myself. I don’t dare to say anything more to you.” Sometimes, we do not have the intention to hurt, but because we are not mindful or skillful enough, we hurt someone. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1368))
- The second thing to do is to try to bring out the best part in ourselves, the part of the flower, to transform ourselves. That is the only way to demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything. Just seeing you like that, she will accept you and forgive you. That is called “speaking with your life and not just with words.” ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1371))

- According to the method of conscious breathing, when we breathe in and out, we stop thinking, because saying “In” and “Out” is not thinking—“In” and “Out” are only words to help us concentrate on our breathing. If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=257))
- Watching a bad TV program, we become the TV program. We are what we feel and perceive. If we are angry, we are the anger. If we are in love, we are love. If we look at a snow-covered mountain peak, we are the mountain. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=275))
- You can use any sound to remind you to pause, breathe in and out, and enjoy the present moment. The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=342))
- When I was four years old, my mother used to bring me a cookie every time she came home from the market. I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=347))
- Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation. We can eat in a way that we restore the cookie of our childhood. The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=354))
- We each looked at our tangerine, and the children were invited to meditate on its origins. They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=360))
- In our daily lives, we may see the people around us, but if we lack mindfulness, they are just phantoms, not real people, and we ourselves are also ghosts. Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=371))
- “The purpose of eating breakfast is to eat breakfast.” ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=379))
- Eating a meal in mindfulness is an important practice. We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times. We can recover ourselves completely after three breaths like this. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=380))
- we look at each person as we breathe in and out in order to be in touch with ourselves and everyone at the table. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=383))
- After breathing, we smile. Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=386))
- After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=389))
- Having the opportunity to sit with our family and friends and enjoy wonderful food is something precious, something not everyone has. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=393))
- the idea that doing dishes is unpleasant can occur only when you aren’t doing them. Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle. The dishes themselves and the fact that I am here washing them are miracles! ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=414))
- Washing the dishes is at the same time a means and an end—that is, not only do we do the dishes in order to have clean dishes, we also do the dishes just to do the dishes, to live fully in each moment while washing them. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=423))
- We feel that there is a vacuum in us and we don’t want to confront it. We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape. Either we turn on the television, pick up the telephone, read a novel, go out with a friend, or take the car and go somewhere. Our civilization teaches us to act this way and provides us with many things we can use to lose touch with ourselves. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=474))

- When you practice half an hour of sitting meditation a day, that time should be for all twenty-four hours, and not just for that half-hour. One smile, one breath, should be for the benefit of the whole day, not just for that moment. We must practice in a way that removes the barrier between practice and non-practice. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=510))
- We should be able to bring the practice from the meditation hall into our daily lives. We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=516))
- The foundation of happiness is mindfulness. The basic condition for being happy is our consciousness of being happy. If we are not aware that we are happy, we are not really happy. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=548))
- When we have a toothache, we know that not having a toothache is a wonderful thing. But when we do not have a toothache, we are still not happy. A non-toothache is very pleasant. There are so many things that are enjoyable, but when we don’t practice mindfulness, we don’t appreciate them. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=549))
- If you can refrain from hoping, you can bring yourself entirely into the present moment and discover the joy that is already here. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=579))
- Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from hope may create a strong reaction. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=583))
- One day the Buddha held up a flower in front of an audience of 1,250 monks and nuns. He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=595))
- When we have an unpleasant feeling, we may want to chase it away. But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=662))
- Mindful observation is based on the principle of “non-duality”: our feeling is not separate from us or caused merely by something outside us; our feeling is us, and for the moment we are that feeling. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=667))
- Our attitude of not clinging to or rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting go, an important part of meditation practice. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=669))
- A teacher has to give birth to the teacher within his student, and a psychotherapist has to give birth to the psychotherapist within his patient. The patient’s “internal psychotherapist” can then work full-time in a very effective way. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=712))
- After recognizing the feeling, becoming one with it, calming it down, and releasing it, we can look deeply into its causes, which are often based on inaccurate perceptions. As soon as we understand the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=717))

- “Breathing in, I know that anger is in me. Breathing out, I know that I am my anger.” If we follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger, it can no longer monopolize our consciousness. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=725))
- Like a fireman, we have to pour water on the blaze first and not waste time looking for the one who set the house on fire. “Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=734))
- When we are angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=737))
- Breathing in, I know that anger is here. Breathing out, I know that the anger is me. Breathing in, I know that anger is unpleasant. Breathing out, I know this feeling will pass. Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out, I am strong enough to take care of this anger. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=767))
- If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding, clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=778))
- If we do not untie our knots when they form, they will grow tighter and stronger. Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=812))
- When we live with another person, to protect each other’s happiness, we should help one another transform the internal formations that we produce together. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=837))
- Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=839))
- In Buddhism, the word “suchness” is used to mean “the essence or particular characteristics of a thing or a person, its true nature.” Each person has his or her suchness. If we want to live in peace and happiness with a person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully and happily together. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=848))
- When we bring natural gas into our homes for heating and cooking, we know the suchness of gas. We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well. ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=851))
- Before he left Vietnam forty years ago, his mother held his hand and told him, “Whenever you miss me, look into your hand, and you will see me immediately.” ([Location 859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=859))
- But I believe that the parents did not mean to plant those seeds. They did not intend to make their children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds, and their father and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=871))
- When we look at our parents with compassion, often we see that our parents are only victims who never had the chance to practice mindfulness. They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all identity with our parents. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=889))
- Every time a seed has an occasion to manifest itself, it produces new seeds of the same kind. If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=903))
- We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=943))
- Life is filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby. Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we have asthma to enjoy our breathing. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=947))
- Awareness of the precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=950))
- When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don’t blame the lettuce. You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=955))
- Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=958))
- When you understand, you cannot help but love. You cannot get angry. To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living beings with the eyes of compassion. When you understand, you cannot help but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=971))
- When we are in contact with another’s suffering, a feeling of compassion is born in us. Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.” ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=992))
- We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know that he is also a victim. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1007))
- So when you hug your child, your friend, your spouse, I recommend that you first breathe in and out consciously and return to the present moment. Then, while you hold him or her in your arms, breathe three times consciously, and you will enjoy your hugging more than ever before. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1033))
- If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1095))
- Real strength is not in power, money, or weapons, but in deep, inner peace. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1150))
- When we sit down to dinner and look at our plate filled with fragrant and appetizing food, we can nourish our awareness of the bitter pain of people who suffer from hunger. ([Location 1252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1252))

- Before each meal, we can join our palms in mindfulness and think about the children who do not have enough to eat. Doing so will help us maintain mindfulness of our good fortune, and perhaps one day we will find ways to do something to help change the system of injustice that exists in the world. ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1259))
- If we cannot smile, we cannot help other people smile. If we are not peaceful, then we cannot contribute to the peace movement. ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1273))
- Meditation is to look deeply into things and to see how we can change ourselves and how we can transform our situation. To transform our situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation. ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1287))
- During any conflict, we need people who can understand the suffering of all sides. For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other sides, that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the situation. This applies to problems of the family as well as to problems of society. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1322))
- “I am sorry, I hurt you out of my ignorance, out of my lack of mindfulness, out of my lack of skillfulness. I will try my best to change myself. I don’t dare to say anything more to you.” Sometimes, we do not have the intention to hurt, but because we are not mindful or skillful enough, we hurt someone. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1368))
- The second thing to do is to try to bring out the best part in ourselves, the part of the flower, to transform ourselves. That is the only way to demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything. Just seeing you like that, she will accept you and forgive you. That is called “speaking with your life and not just with words.” ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1371))

## Highlights
- We are very good at preparing to live, but not very good at living. We know how to sacrifice ten years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get a job, a car, a house, and so on. But we have difficulty remembering that we are alive in the present moment, the only moment there is for us to be alive. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=187))
- Yet even a smile like that is enough to relax all the muscles in our face, to banish all worries and fatigue. A tiny bud of a smile on our lips nourishes awareness and calms us miraculously. It returns to us the peace we thought we had lost. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=206))
- Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile. Dwelling in the present moment, I know this is a wonderful moment! ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=236))
- According to the method of conscious breathing, when we breathe in and out, we stop thinking, because saying “In” and “Out” is not thinking—“In” and “Out” are only words to help us concentrate on our breathing. If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=257))
- Watching a bad TV program, we become the TV program. We are what we feel and perceive. If we are angry, we are the anger. If we are in love, we are love. If we look at a snow-covered mountain peak, we are the mountain. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=275))
- You can use any sound to remind you to pause, breathe in and out, and enjoy the present moment. The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=342))
- When I was four years old, my mother used to bring me a cookie every time she came home from the market. I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=347))
- Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation. We can eat in a way that we restore the cookie of our childhood. The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=354))
- We each looked at our tangerine, and the children were invited to meditate on its origins. They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=360))
- In our daily lives, we may see the people around us, but if we lack mindfulness, they are just phantoms, not real people, and we ourselves are also ghosts. Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=371))
- “The purpose of eating breakfast is to eat breakfast.” ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=379))
- Eating a meal in mindfulness is an important practice. We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times. We can recover ourselves completely after three breaths like this. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=380))
- we look at each person as we breathe in and out in order to be in touch with ourselves and everyone at the table. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=383))
- After breathing, we smile. Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=386))
- After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=389))
- Having the opportunity to sit with our family and friends and enjoy wonderful food is something precious, something not everyone has. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=393))
- the idea that doing dishes is unpleasant can occur only when you aren’t doing them. Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle. The dishes themselves and the fact that I am here washing them are miracles! ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=414))
- Washing the dishes is at the same time a means and an end—that is, not only do we do the dishes in order to have clean dishes, we also do the dishes just to do the dishes, to live fully in each moment while washing them. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=423))
- We feel that there is a vacuum in us and we don’t want to confront it. We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape. Either we turn on the television, pick up the telephone, read a novel, go out with a friend, or take the car and go somewhere. Our civilization teaches us to act this way and provides us with many things we can use to lose touch with ourselves. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=474))

- When you practice half an hour of sitting meditation a day, that time should be for all twenty-four hours, and not just for that half-hour. One smile, one breath, should be for the benefit of the whole day, not just for that moment. We must practice in a way that removes the barrier between practice and non-practice. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=510))
- We should be able to bring the practice from the meditation hall into our daily lives. We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=516))
- The foundation of happiness is mindfulness. The basic condition for being happy is our consciousness of being happy. If we are not aware that we are happy, we are not really happy. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=548))
- When we have a toothache, we know that not having a toothache is a wonderful thing. But when we do not have a toothache, we are still not happy. A non-toothache is very pleasant. There are so many things that are enjoyable, but when we don’t practice mindfulness, we don’t appreciate them. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=549))
- If you can refrain from hoping, you can bring yourself entirely into the present moment and discover the joy that is already here. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=579))
- Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from hope may create a strong reaction. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=583))
- One day the Buddha held up a flower in front of an audience of 1,250 monks and nuns. He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=595))
- When we have an unpleasant feeling, we may want to chase it away. But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=662))
- Mindful observation is based on the principle of “non-duality”: our feeling is not separate from us or caused merely by something outside us; our feeling is us, and for the moment we are that feeling. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=667))
- Our attitude of not clinging to or rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting go, an important part of meditation practice. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=669))
- A teacher has to give birth to the teacher within his student, and a psychotherapist has to give birth to the psychotherapist within his patient. The patient’s “internal psychotherapist” can then work full-time in a very effective way. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=712))
- After recognizing the feeling, becoming one with it, calming it down, and releasing it, we can look deeply into its causes, which are often based on inaccurate perceptions. As soon as we understand the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=717))

- “Breathing in, I know that anger is in me. Breathing out, I know that I am my anger.” If we follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger, it can no longer monopolize our consciousness. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=725))
- Like a fireman, we have to pour water on the blaze first and not waste time looking for the one who set the house on fire. “Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=734))
- When we are angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=737))
- Breathing in, I know that anger is here. Breathing out, I know that the anger is me. Breathing in, I know that anger is unpleasant. Breathing out, I know this feeling will pass. Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out, I am strong enough to take care of this anger. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=767))
- If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding, clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=778))
- If we do not untie our knots when they form, they will grow tighter and stronger. Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=812))
- When we live with another person, to protect each other’s happiness, we should help one another transform the internal formations that we produce together. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=837))
- Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=839))
- In Buddhism, the word “suchness” is used to mean “the essence or particular characteristics of a thing or a person, its true nature.” Each person has his or her suchness. If we want to live in peace and happiness with a person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully and happily together. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=848))
- When we bring natural gas into our homes for heating and cooking, we know the suchness of gas. We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well. ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=851))
- Before he left Vietnam forty years ago, his mother held his hand and told him, “Whenever you miss me, look into your hand, and you will see me immediately.” ([Location 859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=859))
- But I believe that the parents did not mean to plant those seeds. They did not intend to make their children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds, and their father and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=871))
- When we look at our parents with compassion, often we see that our parents are only victims who never had the chance to practice mindfulness. They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all identity with our parents. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=889))
- Every time a seed has an occasion to manifest itself, it produces new seeds of the same kind. If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=903))
- We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=943))
- Life is filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby. Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we have asthma to enjoy our breathing. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=947))
- Awareness of the precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=950))
- When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don’t blame the lettuce. You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=955))
- Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=958))
- When you understand, you cannot help but love. You cannot get angry. To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living beings with the eyes of compassion. When you understand, you cannot help but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=971))
- When we are in contact with another’s suffering, a feeling of compassion is born in us. Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.” ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=992))
- We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know that he is also a victim. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1007))
- So when you hug your child, your friend, your spouse, I recommend that you first breathe in and out consciously and return to the present moment. Then, while you hold him or her in your arms, breathe three times consciously, and you will enjoy your hugging more than ever before. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1033))
- If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1095))
- Real strength is not in power, money, or weapons, but in deep, inner peace. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1150))
- When we sit down to dinner and look at our plate filled with fragrant and appetizing food, we can nourish our awareness of the bitter pain of people who suffer from hunger. ([Location 1252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1252))

- Before each meal, we can join our palms in mindfulness and think about the children who do not have enough to eat. Doing so will help us maintain mindfulness of our good fortune, and perhaps one day we will find ways to do something to help change the system of injustice that exists in the world. ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1259))
- If we cannot smile, we cannot help other people smile. If we are not peaceful, then we cannot contribute to the peace movement. ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1273))
- Meditation is to look deeply into things and to see how we can change ourselves and how we can transform our situation. To transform our situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation. ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1287))
- During any conflict, we need people who can understand the suffering of all sides. For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other sides, that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the situation. This applies to problems of the family as well as to problems of society. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1322))
- “I am sorry, I hurt you out of my ignorance, out of my lack of mindfulness, out of my lack of skillfulness. I will try my best to change myself. I don’t dare to say anything more to you.” Sometimes, we do not have the intention to hurt, but because we are not mindful or skillful enough, we hurt someone. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1368))
- The second thing to do is to try to bring out the best part in ourselves, the part of the flower, to transform ourselves. That is the only way to demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything. Just seeing you like that, she will accept you and forgive you. That is called “speaking with your life and not just with words.” ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1371))

## Highlights
- We are very good at preparing to live, but not very good at living. We know how to sacrifice ten years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get a job, a car, a house, and so on. But we have difficulty remembering that we are alive in the present moment, the only moment there is for us to be alive. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=187))
- Yet even a smile like that is enough to relax all the muscles in our face, to banish all worries and fatigue. A tiny bud of a smile on our lips nourishes awareness and calms us miraculously. It returns to us the peace we thought we had lost. ([Location 206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=206))
- Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile. Dwelling in the present moment, I know this is a wonderful moment! ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=236))
- According to the method of conscious breathing, when we breathe in and out, we stop thinking, because saying “In” and “Out” is not thinking—“In” and “Out” are only words to help us concentrate on our breathing. If we keep breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=257))
- Watching a bad TV program, we become the TV program. We are what we feel and perceive. If we are angry, we are the anger. If we are in love, we are love. If we look at a snow-covered mountain peak, we are the mountain. ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=275))
- You can use any sound to remind you to pause, breathe in and out, and enjoy the present moment. The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the seat belt in your car is a bell of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the rays of sunlight coming through the window, are bells of mindfulness that can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the present moment. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=342))
- When I was four years old, my mother used to bring me a cookie every time she came home from the market. I always went to the front yard and took my time eating it, sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=347))
- Eating mindfully is a most important practice of meditation. We can eat in a way that we restore the cookie of our childhood. The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=354))
- We each looked at our tangerine, and the children were invited to meditate on its origins. They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and be very happy. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=360))
- In our daily lives, we may see the people around us, but if we lack mindfulness, they are just phantoms, not real people, and we ourselves are also ghosts. Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the same. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=371))
- “The purpose of eating breakfast is to eat breakfast.” ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=379))
- Eating a meal in mindfulness is an important practice. We turn off the TV, put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I smile,” three times. We can recover ourselves completely after three breaths like this. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=380))
- we look at each person as we breathe in and out in order to be in touch with ourselves and everyone at the table. ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=383))
- After breathing, we smile. Sitting at the table with other people, we have a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=386))
- After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=389))
- Having the opportunity to sit with our family and friends and enjoy wonderful food is something precious, something not everyone has. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=393))
- the idea that doing dishes is unpleasant can occur only when you aren’t doing them. Once you are standing in front of the sink with your sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle. The dishes themselves and the fact that I am here washing them are miracles! ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=414))
- Washing the dishes is at the same time a means and an end—that is, not only do we do the dishes in order to have clean dishes, we also do the dishes just to do the dishes, to live fully in each moment while washing them. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=423))
- We feel that there is a vacuum in us and we don’t want to confront it. We don’t like being so busy, but every time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. We want to escape. Either we turn on the television, pick up the telephone, read a novel, go out with a friend, or take the car and go somewhere. Our civilization teaches us to act this way and provides us with many things we can use to lose touch with ourselves.

- When you practice half an hour of sitting meditation a day, that time should be for all twenty-four hours, and not just for that half-hour. One smile, one breath, should be for the benefit of the whole day, not just for that moment. We must practice in a way that removes the barrier between practice and non-practice. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=510))
- We should be able to bring the practice from the meditation hall into our daily lives. We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work? These are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not just be a description of something far away. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=516))
- The foundation of happiness is mindfulness. The basic condition for being happy is our consciousness of being happy. If we are not aware that we are happy, we are not really happy. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=548))
- When we have a toothache, we know that not having a toothache is a wonderful thing. But when we do not have a toothache, we are still not happy. A non-toothache is very pleasant. There are so many things that are enjoyable, but when we don’t practice mindfulness, we don’t appreciate them. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=549))
- If you can refrain from hoping, you can bring yourself entirely into the present moment and discover the joy that is already here. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=579))
- Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from hope may create a strong reaction. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=583))
- One day the Buddha held up a flower in front of an audience of 1,250 monks and nuns. He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=595))
- When we have an unpleasant feeling, we may want to chase it away. But it is more effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=662))
- Mindful observation is based on the principle of “non-duality”: our feeling is not separate from us or caused merely by something outside us; our feeling is us, and for the moment we are that feeling. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=667))
- Our attitude of not clinging to or rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting go, an important part of meditation practice. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=669))
- A teacher has to give birth to the teacher within his student, and a psychotherapist has to give birth to the psychotherapist within his patient. The patient’s “internal psychotherapist” can then work full-time in a very effective way. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=712))
- After recognizing the feeling, becoming one with it, calming it down, and releasing it, we can look deeply into its causes, which are often based on inaccurate perceptions. As soon as we understand the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=717))

- “Breathing in, I know that anger is in me. Breathing out, I know that I am my anger.” If we follow our breathing closely while we identify and mindfully observe our anger, it can no longer monopolize our consciousness. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=725))
- Like a fireman, we have to pour water on the blaze first and not waste time looking for the one who set the house on fire. “Breathing in, I know that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=734))
- When we are angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase it away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are the joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists in the flowers. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=737))
- Breathing in, I know that anger is here. Breathing out, I know that the anger is me. Breathing in, I know that anger is unpleasant. Breathing out, I know this feeling will pass. Breathing in, I am calm. Breathing out, I am strong enough to take care of this anger. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=767))
- If we look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding, clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=778))
- If we do not untie our knots when they form, they will grow tighter and stronger. Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feelings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=812))
- When we live with another person, to protect each other’s happiness, we should help one another transform the internal formations that we produce together. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=837))
- Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not overlook it. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=839))
- In Buddhism, the word “suchness” is used to mean “the essence or particular characteristics of a thing or a person, its true nature.” Each person has his or her suchness. If we want to live in peace and happiness with a person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully and happily together. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=848))
- When we bring natural gas into our homes for heating and cooking, we know the suchness of gas. We know that gas is dangerous—it can kill us if we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we are mindful, it can help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as well.

- Before he left Vietnam forty years ago, his mother held his hand and told him, “Whenever you miss me, look into your hand, and you will see me immediately.” ([Location 859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=859))
- But I believe that the parents did not mean to plant those seeds. They did not intend to make their children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds, and their father and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=871))
- When we look at our parents with compassion, often we see that our parents are only victims who never had the chance to practice mindfulness. They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all identity with our parents. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=889))
- Every time a seed has an occasion to manifest itself, it produces new seeds of the same kind. If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling and joy have come up. ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=903))
- We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=943))
- Life is filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes of a baby. Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we have asthma to enjoy our breathing. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=947))
- Awareness of the precious elements of happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=950))
- When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don’t blame the lettuce. You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=955))
- Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=958))
- When you understand, you cannot help but love. You cannot get angry. To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living beings with the eyes of compassion. When you understand, you cannot help but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the suffering of people. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=971))
- When we are in contact with another’s suffering, a feeling of compassion is born in us. Compassion means, literally, “to suffer with.” ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=992))
- We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know that he is also a victim. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1007))
- So when you hug your child, your friend, your spouse, I recommend that you first breathe in and out consciously and return to the present moment.

- If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1095))

- Before each meal, we can join our palms in mindfulness and think about the children who do not have enough to eat. Doing so will help us maintain mindfulness of our good fortune, and perhaps one day we will find ways to do something to help change the system of injustice that exists in the world. ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1259))

- Meditation is to look deeply into things and to see how we can change ourselves and how we can transform our situation. To transform our situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation. ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1287))
- During any conflict, we need people who can understand the suffering of all sides. For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other sides, that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the situation. This applies to problems of the family as well as to problems of society. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1322))
- “I am sorry, I hurt you out of my ignorance, out of my lack of mindfulness, out of my lack of skillfulness. I will try my best to change myself. I don’t dare to say anything more to you.” Sometimes, we do not have the intention to hurt, but because we are not mindful or skillful enough, we hurt someone. ([Location 1368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1368))
- The second thing to do is to try to bring out the best part in ourselves, the part of the flower, to transform ourselves. That is the only way to demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything. Just seeing you like that, she will accept you and forgive you. That is called “speaking with your life and not just with words.” ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0038AUYSW&location=1371))
