Incompetence, iteration to incorporate new talent able to manage how to make movie

Orchestration of great talent.

Management, Lucas let the creatives adopt an idea and make it theirs, and then back off and let them move on  

Overlapped talent for better communication

Flow, get in the zone, a form of meditation. 

Resistance to change from model shop to computer graphics 


Story, story, story. It does not matter if you write it with a pencil or ink. 


Empire they already know how to do it, just better. Goes from complex to complicated
