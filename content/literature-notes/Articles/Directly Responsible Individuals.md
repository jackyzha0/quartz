## Highlights
- Fostering a culture of accountability within the team (people do what they say they will do) is key for effective product management over the long haul. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw0zdg1wpq21jvkkmgbavcd))
- When I’m the DRI on a task, it can sometimes come with a bit of apprehension (*Gulp*, not 100% sure how I’m going to do that . . .but ok I’ll figure it out), or maybe with a bit of grumbling (oh man, I guess I gotta do that too), but being the DRI always comes with a sense of responsibility to the team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw1477t6qncxnrnzcwym8qn))
- When sending email, we are more deliberate with the use of To: vs. CC: fields. The DRI(s) are in the To: list. Everyone else is CC’d. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw14m27rbbxsscnye1wj4gg))
- am I understood by the team to be the DRI on this and should therefore take ownership of reply or resolution?” as opposed to thinking “someone else will probably handle this.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw14yed0vgg1pgbhk385215))
- When working on a new or particularly complex problem where the DRI is not yet known, we seek to establish the DRI early in the discussion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw159yvytdzt4hm3pej9m5b))
- When we gather in meetings, we always leave with action items or next steps. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grw162fsm1q5x80a7mqe51j2))
