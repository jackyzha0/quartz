## Highlights
- When I got into management, I figured that I would have the power to make things right. Then I thought that when I became the leader of all of engineering I could do it. Then I thought that when I became an executive I would be able to do it. Chasing that dream of being able to fix all the things contributed to me feeling exhausted, and dare I say a bit burned out, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gseb8asmfdz1dnsx2zz728v2))
- Assuming that you are not a founder, you should just take a minute to really let it sink in: there is no place you can go where you can control everything and fix all the problems, no matter how much you get promoted. There’s always going to be something you can’t fix. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gseb9a2g490e4kmagg33bpem))
- If you don’t clearly own the problem, you need to talk to people. If you feel tired by the idea of talking to all people, stop! This is a sign that you should not pick this battle! It’s already draining you and you haven’t even started on the path to addressing it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsebycjemv00yt6q8m1c0f02))
- If you’re ok with talking to all the people, then get out there and get a sense of the problem beyond you and your team. You can do this formally, with a document that you prepare addressing the problem as you see it, or informally, as a series of user interviews.

Make a concrete plan for how you will fix it, and share that plan with the people who need to know about it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsec0wyk5c4x33bvdk8caef0))

- Learning how to pick your battles is also about learning how to pick your company and pick your boss, because your job really shouldn’t be all or even mostly about battles. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsg0a9hes154g5y144znjxmc))
- Going through this exercise of solving an unowned problem is fun once in a while, but it’s a real drag when you feel like you’re surrounded by such problems, you can’t ignore them, and you’re powerless to fix them. That is a good sign that it’s time to find a new job, preferably somewhere that is more in tune with your way of doing things ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsg0axmm23tv11s5th48kw8z))
