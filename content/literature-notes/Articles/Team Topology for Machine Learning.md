# Team Topology for Machine Learning

- Document Note: This posts deals with an adaptation of [Team Topology](https://teamtopologies.com/book) to ML applications. In order to break the monolyth in smaller subsystems the book identifies team boundaries based on the cognitive load capacity of teams.
   ML topologies:
   - Stream-aligned ML teams: Develop and manage ML applications for end-users. The scope of the team is determined by the cognitive load of the team. For instance, a recommender system solution might not vary much for residential and not residential assets, so a slightly larger team might deal with both. However, the recommender system might be very different for idealista users vs real estate agencies, requiring two different teams.
   - Data/infrastructure subsystem teams: Data and infrastructure teams are different breads buy they are both specialist subsystem teams. These teams ensure data and infra management policy are centralized.
   - ML Platform teams: Develop end-to-end ML platforms so that stream-aligned ML teams do not have to worry about low-level management and communication between ML artifacts. 
   ```
   A platform is more than just software and APIs — it is documentation, consulting, support, evangelism, templates, and guidelines
   ```
   [What I talk about when I talk about platforms](https://martinfowler.com/articles/talk-about-platforms.html)
   - ML Platform teams: Develop end-to-end ML platforms so that stream-aligned ML teams do not have to worry about low-level management and communication between ML artifacts. 
   - ML Enabling Teams: Internal coaches of stream-aligned ML teams so that they can adopt missing capabilities or use the data platform.

## Highlights
- [Team Topology](https://teamtopologies.com/book) pushes the idea of team-sized software. It stems from [Conway’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) that states an organization will produce a system design following the organization’s communication structure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs3nn5k2yx36hzrqt1rycxb6))
- Based on this idea, the book defines an alternate approach to identify team boundaries based on specific types of four teams, namely, *stream-aligned*, *complicated subsystem*, *platform*, and *enabling* teams. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs3nnhv826ypybpx83t1h7g4))
