## Highlights
- For building successful AI-based chatbots, testing phases include pre-launch and post-launch tests ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzm0xbdt1tkdsedjxhwka1ha))
- • **General Testing:** Testing basic questions and answers like welcome messages.
  • **Domain Testing:** Chatbots are domain-specific and need to have specificities associated with their domain identified and tested upfront.
  • **Limit Testing:** To check how a chatbot responds to an irrelevant question and to identify the outcome when a chatbot fails. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzm0xjvfefjj23ptw9pfad6m))
- • **B Testing:** Discover the product performance by comparing two versions. Organizations can collect data and decide on which version to use.
  • **Conversational Factors:** Validate how the chatbot will start a conversation - this can be either a standard salutation or informal responses like emojis.
  • **Visual Factors:** Although a non-technical aspect, chatbot designs play an important role for user experience. A well-organized, user-friendly, and engaging UX in chatbot messenger can boost retention rates. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzm1hv9ze0adt4t966sqzcwr))
- The efficiency and effectiveness of a chatbot can be verified by testing and comparing the input with the expected output. Chatbot testing is different from traditional software or mobile app testing because chatbot application algorithms are complex and deal with a wide range of user queries.

- **Conversational Design Testing**: Tools that understand natural language recognize input from the user, the response from the bot, and calls to external sources. It allows testers to understand the conversation overview. NLP observes the user input and intent and provides an appropriate response to the end-user. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzm1jx0hp7c41kwn8fq3d4ze))
- **Casual/Small Talks**: The casual conversations like greeting or welcome talks between bot and user. User experience can be improved to a great extent with such small talks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzm1y21seyppwpj4t22cr9yp))
- Bots need to be trained to respond to unfamiliar inputs by writing appropriate test cases to check the fallback phase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzm1y8a1jcy7xy80kskjm865))
- **Navigation:** Navigational cases need to be tested in case the user wants to skip a few steps in a conversation. Chatbots need to be trained on how to handle such cases. For instance, if the order is already placed but the user wants to update or cancel it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzm1ydt760pwwe1x6mww68sn))
- **Botium Box:** This tool allows you to automate chatbot testing using APIs, and the tests will be repeated easily after every software update. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzm1z11axbmzfg7h7jdkz1sm))
- **Selenium:** Selenium web driver and IDE are popularly used for chatbot testing. Chatbots can be tested using Record and Play functionality using Selenium IDE. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzm1z7zdvmt5szkwq8gvx9cr))
- **TestFairy:** It will distribute the chatbot for testing and share the test reports, crash reports, and other valuable feedback with the stakeholders. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzm1zd81c0wykgbpn1trbj3v))
