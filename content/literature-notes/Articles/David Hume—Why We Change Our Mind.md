## Highlights
- As an **empiricist**, David Hume believed that our minds are initially ’empty’. All our knowledge comes **from outside**, we must **observe the external world.**

- This idea is challenged by **rationalists**, who argue that our ability to know things comes **from inside.**

- mistrust our senses and seek **enduring intellectual truths**, empiricists like David Hume focus on **observation**. The ever-changing **physical environment** is their main **source of knowledge**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzez65qw44j8xj5ygr8gv48d))
- Empiricists trust that **this material** **world** around us is not just random and chaotic. What is at the core of this trust? The belief that everything was **caused** by something else. For example, an apple falls from a tree **because** of gravity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzez6g2wc36ktspdg7vpe9ga))
- The concept of **cause and effect** holds everything together. Everything is caused by something, which was in turn caused by something else… and so on. This idea is the universal glue of our material world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzez6v4q1z46a4knm1tv6c0w))
- Two events must be **close to each other** in space and time (contiguity). One of them, the cause, must come **before** the other, the effect (temporal priority). And most importantly: This succession of events must **always** happen (constant conjunction). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzez81t60tnd3n4cvkdxewgw))

- These three characteristics let us **examine the past** and **predict the future**! For example, when we see a human footprint in the sand, we can assume that somebody has walked there **in the past**.

- Here is his explanation: Imagine you witness one billiard ball hit another. You see the first ball moving—then you hear a smacking sound. The first ball stops to a halt, while the second ball starts to move. **Why** did the second ball move? **Because** it was hit by the first one. We assume a **necessary** connection. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzez974mg6spx9k8kem3kn97))
- Whenever we see events happen one after another **often enough, we believe there’s a connection.** This is **not a rational justification**! But a little caution is in order. Hume does **not doubt** that everything is connected by cause and effect. He just points out that this is an assumption based on **habit**, not on compelling rational logic.

- **Deduction**
  We start with **general** principles and draw **specific** conclusions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzezba0jc130bhe5m5kv8vwm))
- A second kind of argument starts with **specific examples** and guesses a **general** rule ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzezbjnbaesmex0bffmt4pv4))
- This kind of argument is called **induction**. It is based on probability, not on certainty.
  In short, **deductions** move from **general rules to specific cases with certainty**, while **inductions** move **from specific cases to general rules with probability**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzezbtej4eaa76jmtgbaajnm))

- When we observe phenomena in the material world to discover rules or ‘natural laws’, we use inductive reasoning. Hume’s discovery was that this kind of inductive thinking is **not based on reason** but on **a feeling that the future resembles the past**. As a result, every scientific theory we develop is just that: a theory. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzezckbttq6f79q0tnfwttex))
- Our habit to **assume causal connections** when we observe things repeatedly can also explain our **inclination to superstition** or to **accept lies if they are repeated** often enough ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzezd65gz3baah43k1bpetac))
