## Highlights
- A *strategy* is an approach to a challenge that recommends specific actions that address the challenge’s constraints. [A structure that I’ve found extremely effective](https://lethain.com/good-strategy-bad-strategy/) is described in [Good Strategy, Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004J4WKEC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), and has three sections: *diagnosis*, *policies* and *actions*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsnfpze4fb7hfdrt2fskhwh))
- The *diagnosis* is a theory describing the challenge at hand. It calls out the factors and constraints that define the challenge, and at its core is a very thorough problem statement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsnkag6thg68hh2c2sjdffz))
- The second step is to identify *policies* that will be applied to address the challenge. These describe the general approach you’ll take, and are often tradeoffs between two competing goals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsnjtqetnz3bm9ny1705kde))
- your diagnosis, you get your *actions*. Folks are often comfortable with hard decisions in the abstract, but struggle to translate them into the specific steps to implement them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsnjm3f8tfwpv6at6knqr0s))
- An effective vision helps folks think beyond the constraints of their local maxima, and lightly aligns progress without requiring tight centralized coordination. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsnr1g0n7q9japy9fpq4tm0))
- Put all these pieces together, and you’ve crafted a document that is a guiding hand to align decisions while also creating room for teams to make their own choices and tradeoffs along the way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grsp16q2jxs6atvs7593hwxa))
