## Highlights
- he goal of an antilibrary is not to collect books you have read so you can proudly display them on your shelf; instead, it is to curate a highly personal collection of resources around themes you are curious about. Instead of a celebration of everything you know, an antilibrary is an ode to everything you want to explore. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5phj3fx7bbw96y14mf2ahs5))
