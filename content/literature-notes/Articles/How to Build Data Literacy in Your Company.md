   Data literacy definition involves reading data, working with data, analyzing data and being able to argue with data. [Paper](https://dam-prod.media.mit.edu/x/2016/10/20/Edu_D'Ignazio_52.pdf)
   Challenging because requires high level in skills that haven't usually been taught together: data analysis + effective data communication
   Not everyone needs to become a data scientist, it is important to assess the level of skills needed by each role.
   Why you need data literacy:
   - Data literates make better decisions
   - Decisions have to be taken faster than ever
   Data literacy roadmap:
   1. Define data literacy goals
   2. Assess current skills levels
   3. Design learning paths
   Principles:
   Focus on data, not on technology
   Agree on the level of proficiency fo different job types
   Avoid jargon
   Define success metrics
   In order to become data driven: we also need data maturity, data-driven leadership and data-drive decision making
