- Managers today are exhausted from a combination of high workload and limited resources. While all employees can relate to this challenge, managers have the added responsibility of ensuring their team members get what they need to succeed, on top of doing their own work.

- At Microsoft, our internal, biannual census focuses specifically on the concept of [thriving](https://hbr.org/2022/06/why-microsoft-measures-employee-thriving-not-engagement) and how we can help people feel energized and empowered to do meaningful work. To ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0tq4ym1s9vn41zh4yrekc9a))
- we found that managers are more likely than individual contributors to experience exhaustion and lack of professional efficacy. We also found managers who manage individual contributors (i.e., front-line managers) are more likely to experience cynicism than managers who manage other managers (i.e., middle managers). As managers climb the organization and as the scope of their roles increase, they feel more meaning and energy from their work which can help reduce cynicism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0tq78edx1m112gpzy2t9c9r))
- we found that experiencing burnout can lead to negative outcomes for the manager and the company, like reduced productivity and turnover. For instance, while self-reported productivity tends to be lower in managers experiencing any single dimension of burnout ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0tq7p9dn2hn81dezcm4rcwt))
- Finding ways to connect front-line managers’ work with what matters to them could help buffer potential negative effects of burnout. Managers should reflect on their roles and have open conversations with their leader about what gives them energy and meaning at work, and what detracts from it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0tq9fjhtjz7b6bw21f5va5b))
- Managers and their leader should also consider new projects that might provide a burst of energy at work, have open conversations about what’s needed to accomplish their goals, and be transparent about potential career paths at the company ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0tq9vcq1zkv1jxcw6k6nhhh))
- As a manager, don’t think that you need to hide the fact that you may need help, too. Prepare for your one-on-one’s with your leader and share your prioritization ideas with them to gain their support. Speaking up in a productive way with recommendations and solutions provide space for active dialog and healthy conversations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0tqbbpk2qgsxbnnerd2hwe1))
- It is also important to empower [managers to care for themselves](https://hbr.org/2019/03/how-to-help-your-team-with-burnout-when-youre-burned-out-yourself), or “put their own oxygen masks on first,” before focusing on their teams. When managers focus on themselves first, it not only [models the right behaviors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2022/03/16/the-managers-role-in-burnout-prevention/?sh=7433b59c72ce), but it also allows them to be more present for their employees ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0tqbxaev3ryjezy8g9n6dc0))
- We also provide quick guides on how to set boundaries and respect others’ boundaries, and guides for having these discussions with your teams. Once a manager [learns these skills themselves](https://hbr.org/2022/03/what-first-time-managers-can-do-to-manage-burnout), they have an easier time encouraging their employees to do the same.
