## Highlights
- As the landscape becomes increasingly data-driven, fueled by the rise of ML and AI, the importance of data engineering as a function continues to climb steadily year after year. Organizations now rely heavily on data to make every decision; data has become a requirement across every business unit, with the desire for more never stoppin ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytc37cwh18gqm0yayat7exv))
- Data engineers have become the backbone for building and maintaining the infrastructure and tools necessary to collect, store, and process the increasing size and velocity of data being produced every second. ***There has never been a better time to become a data engineer or take your data engineering career to the next level.*** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytc3ryketgwkyq6t5jqem5h))
- The skill of architecture related to being a data engineering force multiplier has to do with the bigger picture; being able to lift your head above the weeds, the favorite tools, and ask the correct questions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytc5nmg42cec9pg4cdd32te))
- Never underestimate the skill of being a good architect as a data engineer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytc6829rx5srvyekfwgcxrx))
- [Data modeling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dwh/dwh_olap.htm) is one of those popular topics that everyone likes to talk about, but it also has a myriad of approaches that depend a lot on the technical context. The process of creating a conceptual representation of the [data structure](https://dataengineeringcentral.substack.com/p/dsa-for-the-rest-of-us-part-1) and relationships between data entities in a system is a core technical skill for any data engineer. Being a great data modeler is another must-have skill to be a data engineering force multiplier. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytc81gj3ck6dypx029s7vk7))
- To be a data engineering force multiplier, a good data engineer must be able to understand data access patterns, usage cases, requirements, and technology ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytc8zwg6pwgz93wantxdxyn))
- Data engineers must be proficient in programming languages such as [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBs7w770RQM), Java, Go, Rust, [SQL](https://www.confessionsofadataguy.com/database-sql-fundamentals-for-data-engineers/), etc ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytcc03kewpmqgmgy018erpt))
- Probably one of the most under-utilized pieces of good software engineering best practices in the data engineering space is the concept of CI/CD. Good ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytccxnbp7md6pk0yx173y0x))
- The best part about a data engineer who can implement CI/CD is that they save the team and company time and money. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytcd5vmtw7h3z23jebybcrs))
