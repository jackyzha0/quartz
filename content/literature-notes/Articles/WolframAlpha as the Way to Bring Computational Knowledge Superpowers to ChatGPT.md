  Wolfram|Alpha as the Way to Bring Computational Knowledge Superpowers to ChatGPT
  Wolfram|Alpha as the Way to Bring Computational Knowledge Superpowers to ChatGPT ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grxsqamrhb8w92df7rxbdvsx))
- For decades there’s been a dichotomy in thinking about AI between “statistical approaches” of the kind ChatGPT uses, and “symbolic approaches” that are in effect the starting point for Wolfram|Alpha. But now—thanks to the success of ChatGPT—as well as all the work we’ve done in making Wolfram|Alpha understand natural language—there’s finally the opportunity to combine these to make something much stronger than either could ever achieve on their own. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grv9x2xegdjzdcg9jzrevhey))
- one might think that if one could just go on and “train a big enough network” one would be able to do absolutely anything with it. But it won’t work that way. Fundamental facts about computation—and notably the concept of [computational irreducibility](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility)—make it clear it ultimately can’t. But what’s more relevant is what we’ve seen in the actual history of machine learning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grva7n2n5xw4rfqcp8fc6t72))
- And yes, there’ll be plenty of cases where “raw ChatGPT” can help with people’s writing, make suggestions, or generate text that’s useful for various kinds of documents or interactions. But when it comes to setting up things that have to be perfect, machine learning just isn’t the way to do it—much as humans aren’t either. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grva821x2dtsd7qwbxzktex7))
- Wolfram|Alpha can communicate with it in what amounts to ChatGPT’s native language—natural language. And Wolfram|Alpha will take care of “adding the formality and precision” when it converts to its native language—Wolfram Language. It’s a very good situation, that I think has great practical potential. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grva9nsnacg93ne9fz5jv07g))
- What about ChatGPT directly learning Wolfram Language? Well, yes, it could do that, and in fact it’s already started. And in the end I fully expect that something like ChatGPT will be able to [operate directly in Wolfram Language](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2015/11/how-should-we-talk-to-ais/), and be very powerful in doing so.
