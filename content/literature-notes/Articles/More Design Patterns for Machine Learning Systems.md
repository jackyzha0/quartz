## Highlights
- Design patterns are reusable, time-tested solutions to common problems in software engineering ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyta8xzpasemwqsmqx2bnfe1))
- Here, I’d like to share a couple of patterns I’ve seen in machine learning systems. Some of them, such as process data once and evaluate before deploy, may seem basic to seasoned practitioners ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyta96mv5e97n8018hjz5ts6))
- A key pattern when designing data pipelines is to consolidate and process raw data just once, preferably early on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyta9jqs2ypz5kw6nf7vnb4a))
- **Pros:** Reduces redundancy and streamlines data processing jobs, making the data pipeline more efficient and maintainable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyta9vbh4fewdcfn5fb21qtm))
- Processing and aggregating data so it flexibly supports various downstream use cases can be challenging. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gytaa15t00wpp7yb7k00awfm))
