## Highlights
- I’d been meeting with the team from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) since 2016 and was impressed by their steady progress. In mid-2022, I was so excited about their work that I gave them a challenge: train an artificial intelligence to pass an Advanced Placement biology exam. Make it capable of answering questions that it hasn’t been specifically trained for. (I picked AP Bio because the test is more than a simple regurgitation of scientific facts—it asks you to think critically about biology.) If you can do that, I said, then you’ll have made a true breakthrough ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwensdkyvr1zhq3p4na32jnn))
- The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwenv7t7q0cx1cy9h4k2keax))
- Philanthropy is my full-time job these days, and I’ve been thinking a lot about how—in addition to helping people be more productive—AI can reduce some of the world’s worst inequities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwenvtjmz2mv2zf2yr2qdp75))
- the best opportunity for reducing inequity is to improve education, particularly making sure that students succeed at math. The evidence shows that having basic math skills sets students up for success, no matter what career they choose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwenws84a0jgz5jd66eqm0vy))
- The world needs to make sure that everyone—and not just people who are well-off—benefits from artificial intelligence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gweny2y3djs9dtc5h67h48xb))
- the term *artificial intelligence* refers to a model created to solve a specific problem or provide a particular service. What is powering things like [ChatGPT](https://chatgptonline.net/) is artificial intelligence. It is learning how to do chat better but can’t learn other tasks. By contrast, the term a*rtificial general intelligence* refers to software that’s capable of learning any task or subject. AGI doesn’t exist yet—there is a robust debate going on in the computing industry about how to create it, and whether it can even be created at all.

- Since a huge portion of it is now turning its attention to AI, the innovations are going to come much faster than what we experienced after the microprocessor breakthrough. Soon the pre-AI period will seem as distant as the days when using a computer meant typing at a C:> prompt rather than tapping on a screen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwfpxf5htrad6wtz45v5a9hr))
- As computing power gets cheaper, GPT’s ability to express ideas will increasingly be like having a white-collar worker available to help you with various tasks. Microsoft describes this as having a co-pilot ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwfpzyaagpwnbwkc4szjhhms))
- Eventually your main way of controlling a computer will no longer be pointing and clicking or tapping on menus and dialogue boxes. Instead, you’ll be able to write a request in plain English ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwfq0aq4jj76rnqw72g1h123))
- addition, advances in AI will enable the creation of a personal agent. Think of it as a digital personal assistant: It will see your latest emails, know about the meetings you attend, read what you read, and read the things you don’t want to bother with. This will both improve your work on the tasks you want to do and free you from the ones you don’t want to do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwfqc3t7c9jp5w5sh8rj9k7c))
- You’ll be able to use natural language to have this agent help you with scheduling, communications, and e-commerce, and it will work across all your devices. Because of the cost of training the models and running the computations, creating a personal agent is not feasible yet, but thanks to the recent advances in AI, it is now a realistic goal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwfqcre4gbn75re2m6xb7j2e))
- can an insurance company ask your agent things about you without your permission? If so, how many people will choose not to use it? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwfqd36981fh17re70p9rnhw))
- Company-wide agents will empower employees in new ways. An agent that understands a particular company will be available for its employees to consult directly and should be part of every meeting so it can answer questions. It can be told to be passive or encouraged to speak up if it has some insight. It will need access to the sales, support, finance, product schedules, and text related to the company. It should read news related to the industry the company is in. I believe that the result will be that employees will become more productive ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwfqhhqt5c3gjky2qaa7br7t))

- For one thing, they’ll help health-care workers make the most of their time by taking care of certain tasks for them—things like filing insurance claims, dealing with paperwork, and drafting notes from a doctor’s visit. I expect that there will be a lot of innovation in this area. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh69mr7d0qnmst4ca4zn69f))
- For example, many people in those countries never get to see a doctor, and AIs will help the health workers they do see be more productive. (The effort to develop [AI-powered ultrasound machines](https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Year-Ahead-2023#ALChapter6) that can be used with minimal training is a great example of this.) AIs will even give patients the ability to do basic triage, get advice about how to deal with health problems, and decide whether they need to seek treatment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh6aaz2s330g7zjx6d06p7p))
- People will need to see evidence that health AIs are beneficial overall, even though they won’t be perfect and will make mistakes. AIs have to be tested very carefully and properly regulated, which means it will take longer for them to be adopted than in other areas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh6b2hhn4dn7kd2bk0v9q55))
- Computers haven’t had the effect on education that many of us in the industry have hoped. There have been some good developments, including educational games and online sources of information like Wikipedia, but they haven’t had a meaningful effect on any of the measures of students’ achievement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwh6c2kv3yjwq00745p1kyy2))
- AI-driven software will finally deliver on the promise of revolutionizing the way people teach and learn. It will know your interests and your learning style so it can tailor content that will keep you engaged. It will measure your understanding, notice when you’re losing interest, and understand what kind of motivation you respond to. It will give immediate feedback.
