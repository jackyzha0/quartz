- [DJ Patil](https://twitter.com/dpatil), former United States Chief Data Scientist, defined a data product as “a product that facilitates an end goal through the use of data” (from his book *Data Jujitsu: The Art of Turning Data into Product,* 2012 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcqcr9ry9wz5kdf7mfbp4cq))
- [Simon O’Regan](https://twitter.com/Simon_O_Regan) published an article called [Designing Data Products](https://towardsdatascience.com/designing-data-products-b6b93edf3d23) that lists very clear examples of data products and groups them by type: raw data, derived data, algorithms, decision support and automated decision-making.

- One of the principles of the data mesh paradigm is to consider [data as a product](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html#DataAsAProduct). Sometimes this principle has been abbreviated to “data products”, hence the confusion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqcqj5ydrpa54rqtq4apfk4m))
