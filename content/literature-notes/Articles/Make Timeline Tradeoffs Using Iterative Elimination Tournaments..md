## Highlights
- An iterative elimination tournament is a competition where you have to win your current round before advancing to play in the next round. If you don’t win, you don’t keep playing. If you have a great strategy for next round, but don’t do well in the current round, then you’ll never get a chance to take advantage of that strategy. If you have a great approach for today, but no plan for tomorrow, it’ll be a futre mired with regrets.
  This model is so effective because it focuses you on (1) identifying what success looks like over various time frames, (2) selecting an evolution of approaches for your shifting needs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs6b7b9r9k38tmj55ex8b62q))
