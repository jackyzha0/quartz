## Highlights
- Initial customers show up for unique reasons, and their interests aren’t representative of what other people want. The further the company gets from that group, the more it struggles to sell. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqafftwnza9k98wt409syref))

Two years ago, Erik Bernhardsson [wrote a story](https://erikbern.com/2021/07/07/the-data-team-a-short-story.html) about navigating the same problems of being misunderstood, left out, and asked to do the wrong work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqafph785fh3qv9qjkc0j3qk))

We’ve [shared intake forms](https://www.caitlinhudon.com/posts/2020/09/16/data-intake-form). We’ve [built products](https://www.secoda.co/data-ticketing).

Experimentation and the scientific method!—and our job is to sell it; we should instead ask them why they don’t want it.
