## Highlights
- PLR technique: pause, link, and rehearse. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzgpzqmdzy6s4gsggks7nb9))

Did you eat something delicious? Replay small but lovely occurrences you’d like to savor. “The more you do that, over time you realize you’ll actually be able to remember more details of your life ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqzgvdsgx6pcqanqng538t7k))
