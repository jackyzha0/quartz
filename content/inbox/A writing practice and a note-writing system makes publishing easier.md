# A writing practice and a note-writing system makes publishing easier

To make writing a publishable artifact easier, one needs to:

1. Establish a daily writing practice (which, later on, can be easily converted into a more specific way of writing: note-writing).
2. [[Use a note-writing system]] like [[Zettelkasten]] or [[Talahardin]].

A daily conversation with a note-writing system produces written pieces ([[Evergreens]]) that can eventually be combined to create a publishable artifact. This is easier than writing a publishable artifact from scratch. Doing so also assures that the quality of the publishable artifact is far superior, because the notes used to write the publishable artifact have gone through repeated revisiting and revisions. This is why we need to [[Write way before working on a publishable artifact]].
