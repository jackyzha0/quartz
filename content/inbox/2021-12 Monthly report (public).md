# 2021-12 Monthly report (public)

Hi!

This is a list of movements in my studies, projects, and life in general during December 2021.

# Changes

## Studies

- I adopted literature notes on Zettelkasten and Evergreen notes into permanent notes about Talahardin.
- I spent a good amount of time pondering about the question: [[Why does one opt to live in public?]]
- I designed a [[thoughts/my studying process]] and applied it while reading [[a philosophy of walking - gros]].
- I watched this 100 rabbits talk and was inspired to question about what I stand for: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU). This talk also got me interested about opensource software, Linux, and the right to repair. I don't think I will be buying another Apple product again.
- I articulated [[My strategy for sharing]], which necessitated that I include [[My daily review routine]] in [[My daily routine]]. This also required updates on how I do [[Review]] in general.

## Projects

- I learned a lot about proper management of pests at home after solving a flea infestation problem this month. Tip: Don’t opt to highly toxic pesticides immediately. Vacuuming, washing clothes, and treating pets might be all you need.
- I tried out writing [[Walk narratives]] that combine writings about what I see and thought about during each walk. One notable narrative I wrote was my walk to [[Walk narratives#Fri, Dec 17, 2021]].
- After installing curtains, buying an ergonomic chair, and receiving a speaker as a Christmas gift, my minimum viable workstation looks and feels great.
- As an extension of my sharing strategy, I started thinking more about being more intentional with the design of my website ([vinceimbat.com](https://vinceimbat.com/)) I started learning website design using [Flux Academy’s Free Web Design Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXC_gcsKLD6n7p6tHPBxsKjN5hA_quaPI). My goal for January 2022 is to arrive at a final design for the website and also learn development so I can build and launch it by myself.
- To start 2022, I will be experimenting with [[Fitz Villafuerte’s budgeting strategy]].

# Others

- This month was my first to travel to Manila again after about two years since the pandemic started.
- I discovered and played Anomia—such a fun game!
- Film of the month: [Toc Toc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIgtBUIOb4c)
- Song of the month: [After Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waAlgFq9Xq8)
- Nice podcast: [70 Over 70](https://open.spotify.com/show/65RvOjAxR3ty5LMQ6CGcBp)
