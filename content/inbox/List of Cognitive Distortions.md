# List of Cognitive Distortions

When applying [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]], take note of the following cognitive distortions:

1. **All-or-nothing thinking.** Also called "dichotomous thinking”. You evaluate qualities in extreme, black-or-white categories. This is unrealistic because qualities are rarely dichotomous. It breeds perfectionism and discrediting because actions will never match the exaggerated expectations.
2. **Overgeneralization.** You conclude that something will happen over and over again. Without overgeneralization, a single affront is just temporarily disappointing. With overgeneralization, a single affront will be seriously disturbing.
3. **Mental filter.** Also called "selective abstraction". You perceive an entire situation as negative because of a single negative detail.
4. **Disqualifying the positive.** You transform neutral or even positive experiences into negative ones.
5. **Jumping to conclusions.** You jump into a negative conclusion without enough evidence.
   1. **Mind reading.** You make an assumption about what people think of you and you don't verify this because you're so convinced about it.
   2. **Fortune teller error.** You predict that something bad will happen to you and take it as a fact even if it is unrealistic.
6. **Magnification and minimization.** You magnify your faults interpreting them as disasters, while you minimize your strengths.
7. **Emotional reasoning.** You use your emotions as evidence for truth. Emotions are reflections of your thoughts. If you have distorted thoughts, you have invalid emotions.
8. **Should statements.** You pressure yourself or othes with should and must statements, which lead to apathy and frustration. Failing to meet our standards result to negative emotions.
9. **Labeling and mislabeling.** You create a completely negative image of yourself, another person, or an event based on errors (e.g. I am a born loser). It is irrational because you can't equate yourself or another person with one thing. Mislabeling also uses inacurrate and emotionally heavily loaded words.
10. **Personalization.** You assume responsibility for a wrong event with no real basis. This causes a lot of guilt. This is irrational because you can influence others or events but not control them.

Use these distortions when practicing the [[Triple-column technique]].
