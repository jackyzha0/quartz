# Walking accomplishes multiple goals

[[thoughts/walking]] is a great addition to any writer’s daily routine because it hits multiple birds with one stone.

When we walk,

- we create an opportunity for physical activity,
- we create a space for creativity (e.g., practice photography),
- we get the psychological benefits of being in nature,
- we can be exposed to misfortune, which could test mental fortitude and emotional stability ([[Stoicism]]).

Walking favors [[thoughts/process over product]] and is [[Circular over linear]] ([[Austin Kleon - The creative life is not linear]]).

I have always incorporated walking (or biking) in [[My daily routine]]. I also tried following [[The fieldwork routine of Thoreau]]. However, I find it too time-consuming, which shows the mental investment that [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]] gave to his process. He really loved nature. It was his workplace.

I don’t need to adopt such investment on doing fieldworks though. A 1-2 hour walk in the afternoon will usually suffice in benefiting any serious writer. Aside from a daily walk, a monthly fieldwork, or something like what [[thoughts/craig mod]] does, that combines excursion to nature and art could surely work.
