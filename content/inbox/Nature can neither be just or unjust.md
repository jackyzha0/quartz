# Nature can neither be just or unjust

[[A spontaneous order can neither be just or unjust]].

This is because [[A spontaneous order has no personal intention]] and [[No personal intention in a spontaneous order means no justice or injustice]].

Nature is an [[Spontaneous order]]. Therefore, Nature can neither be just or unjust.

Nature can only be just or unjust if it is a personal creator, who has the ability to intend.

[[The economy is part of nature]] or it is, at least, a spontaneous order. And that is why, like Nature, [[The economy can neither be just nor unjust]].
