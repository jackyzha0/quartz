# Create a relationship with your craft devoid of expectations

Obviously, [[Sharing]] is an important part of any creative career. However, just focusing on fulfilling our need for other people to listen to us could encourage us to constantly set expectations for our craft. Usually, these expectations involve a desire for people to notice us, and when they don’t, we feel bad. This is what happens when [[Sharing gone wrong]].

How can we combat this?

We need to create a different kind of relationship with our craft—a very intimate relationship that is devoid of expectations. This is a state where we are our own audience. We are only communicating with ourselves. We transform our craft into a life saver. If we don’t do it, we will literally die.

This space is the first step in the [[Cautious sharing process]].
