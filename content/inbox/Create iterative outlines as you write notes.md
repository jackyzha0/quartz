# Create iterative outlines as you write notes

After you write a [[Evergreens]] ([[how to convert literature notes to permanent notes]]), add it to one or more outlines you have. When you [[Combine curiosity with a note-writing system and practice]] daily, you will naturally notice the connections between notes, which will bear writing projects.

Create an outline by simply comparing two notes and asking which should come first.

Writing from bottom-up prevents you from making preconceived conclusions ([[Writing using permanent notes encourages a scout mindset]]).

   When you write a new note, add it to one or more **outlines** you’re maintaining, creating a new one if necessary. Substantially-complete writing projects will naturally emerge.

   Maintaining already-written notes in an outline is comparatively easy: just look at a pair of notes and ask: which comes first? (Pirsig)
