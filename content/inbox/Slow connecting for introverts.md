# Slow connecting for introverts

As a creative, I adhere to the admonition to [[Hone your craft and engage your audience]]. However, as an [[Introvert]], engaging an audience does not come natural to me. Because of this, below are my ideas on how I can approach the task of [[Connecting]] in a way that feels less frightening. This augments my [[Strategy for Connecting]].

Steps:

1. Just research who your people are and where they could possibly be hanging out.
2. Join promising communities and lurk for a while, reading posts and comments.
3. When you have something to contribute and are ready to cheer others, post some comments on existing posts.
4. When you have made friends inside the community and feel more confident, post your own posts (insights, questions).
5. Eventually, when you have established at least one close relationship, you can arrange for an audio call with that one person.
6. Then arrange a video call.
7. When you are more confident, join community calls.

To do

- Reflect: Did I do this? Does this actually work for me? Update if necessary.
