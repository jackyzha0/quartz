# Running the Special Projects Membership Program - Craig Mod

December 2018 started it.

- CM was a bit lost.
   - He was not succeeding.
- Wrote an article for WIRED based on his Yale lecture.
   - This exposed him to different available platforms for membership, so he asked himself, should I start a membership?
- Talked to media establishments and agencies and said he wants to be a better writer, should he work for them?
   - They said, you have an audience, you know what you want to write about, and you have a lot of agency, why not lean into that?
   - Writers inside newsrooms actually want to be independent writers with audiences.
- Decided to launch a membership program.
- How he launched it
   - Simple. Treat it as an MVP.
   - Memberships: Memberful. No to constraints of Patreon and Substack.
   - Email: Campaign Monitor (Buttondown? Ghost?)
   - Site: Hugo (11ty?)
- Launched in January 2019.
   - Depressing. He didn’t get to a hundred in day 1.
   - Not successful.
   - He launched it without really knowing what it will be for.
   - How CM got over depression.
      - Get over it. You already had people giving you a grant.
      - Fight for each sub.
- After getting his mental doubts, he planned his first big walk in May 2019.
   - Nakasendō
   - SMS publishing experiment
   - Established rules for walks
   - Biggest insight: Membership payments = Permission to do what you want to do
      - You don’t need publication, book deals, etc.
- Design problem during the walk: asynchronous vs real-time communication
- Walk rules
   - No media
   - No social networks
   - No podcasts
   - Consolidate collected data every day
   - Publish SMS ever night (image + text)
   - Shoot portraits before 10 am (you just connect with people)
- How do you share all of this while still being present?
   - SMS publishing
   - Benefits
      - Bigger, more thoughtful “loop” (~3 months “wide”)
      - Context affects intimacy
      - Obvious contract
      - Not pulled out of the moment
      - Leverage global network access
- Wrote his walk in Wired, which did good.
- Consider the size of your “loops”
- Most importantly: An object, a totem, a memento (should do more books)
- Played with video
   - Published pop-up walk as video
   - Just used iPhone with earpods + FilMic app that allowed earpods to be used as mic
- 2020 Video
   - Pandemic inspired
   - Boring livestreams
   - Walk updates
   - Get used with camera and tools
- No travel, so just do the book.
   - Thought about book design again.
   - Launched Kissa by Kissa August 2020.
      - $100 per copy
      - 1000 copies
      - Expected to sell only 300 copies
      - Sold out in 2 days
- Craigstarter
   - Better than kickstarter
   - Must have coupons
   - Crowdfunding + Shipping all in one place = Shopify
- 18 months from launching, CM was only able to articulate his goal.
   - SP Purpose: A continious and rigorous production of book-shaped projects (projects that support the books, lead to books, or the book projects themselves)
   - He used this purpose to say yes to opportunities that aligned with it and say no to those that didn’t align.
- Through the money he made from the memberships, he invested in technology to make the videos.
   - The documentary led to 200 book sales ($200,000).
   - He invested $10,000 in equipment.
- Year 4
   - Using his accumulated research and fieldwork, he can have ~4 more books he could do now just by sitting in the next six months.
   - Leverage systems and infrastructures
- Years
   - 1: MVP, does this work? is there interest? what can I produce?
   - 2: Product market fit (i.e., books and memberships)
   - 3: Improve the infrastructures that support and are around the book production nicer (printing, video, etc.)
   - 4: To leverage these systems to produce a solid body of work.
