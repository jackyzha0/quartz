# Sharing gone wrong

Sharing any work of art gets wrong if we do it “exclusively” for others. In the “creating for others” mindset, we create:

- what will sell
- what will get likes
- what will give us validation

The intention behind this mindset is growth. With this intention, we immediately share a work to a large group of friends or strangers, usually on social media, who don’t even really care about our work. We share out of context.

What happens when we share out of context is that we get very little engagement. Furthermore, the platforms we share at have built-in metrics designed to make us feel bad when we don’t perform well. This process can have detrimental effects to our psychological well-being and confidence as creators.

Growth and popularity are not necessarily bad things. Some people are wired to go after these. But some are not, and for them, there has to be another way. An alternative [[Sharing]] process for highly sensitive people is the [[Cautious sharing process]].
