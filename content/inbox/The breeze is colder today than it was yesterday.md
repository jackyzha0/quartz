The breeze is colder today than it was yesterday.

The breeze is colder today than it was yesterday.

Although I did felt the cold air yesterday.

There are lower clouds enveloping the tip of one of the mountains.

And there is a fog-like canopy over the entire range.

I'm expecting rain soon. This coming week. I hope I experience at least one in the afternoon, or any other time, before I go to Manila to meet Lauren. That would be really nice.

People are still picking up mongo beans. Indeed, there are still a lot to harvest.
