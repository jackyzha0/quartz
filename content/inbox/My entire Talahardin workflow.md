# My entire Talahardin workflow

**Use convergence tools to find and filter information.**

Convergence tools include purpose, values, or interests

Intend to only pursue information related to your current projects and interests

Manage information in flow.

Engage with that information

Start a learning project.

Decide which books and materials to read and consume.

Collect information from books and materials efficiently.

It is difficult to cultivate the Talahardin. Here are some guidelines:

# Collecting information

Given the shortness of life, our relationship to information needs to be minimalistic. A good rule of thumb when letting information in our lives is to [[Only consume information that is relevant to your purpose]]. This requires self-knowledge about what is truly important to you.

Once this is established, setup [[A system to capture and filter information]]. This filtering system involves using multiple inboxes that capture information in different media. These first-level inboxes are then pruned regularly to choose only the best sources of information to consume. These best sources are then placed in a second-level inbox—a [[Reading inbox]]—which once again is process by (1) consuming infomation, (2) deleting resources that no longer resonate, and (3) letting other resources age.

When a resource is consumed, capture [[Fleeting notes]] like [[literature notes]] effectively ([[how to write literature notes]]) and collect them in a [[writing inbox]] if the information is not attached to a particular project. If it is related to a project, attach it to a [[Project inbox]] instead.

# Processing information

## Processing the writing inbox

Once the writing inbox is filled up, the Talahardin employs a [[Spaced repetition writing system]] to effectively process a growing writing inbox. Here is [[How to setup a spaced repetition writing system in Craft]].

To work effectively (i.e., to avoid accumulating too much fleeting notes in the writing inbox), this note-processing system has to be done in a regular basis (ideally daily) and therefore should be embedded in something like [[My daily routine]] ([[thoughts/my morning writing practice]]).

Processing fleeting notes in the writing inbox also requires that [[Evergreens]] are written. It is difficult to do these but here are some guidelines:

- [[how to convert literature notes to permanent notes]]
- [[Write permanent notes about what you read to test understanding]]
- [[Fill permanent notes with links to other notes]]
- [[Link relevant permanent notes to a corresponding structure note]]

# Key differences between Zettelkasten, Evergreen notes, and Talahardin

The Talahardin system is heavily influenced by [[Andy Matuschak]]'s [[Evergreen note-taking system]], which, in turn, was heavily influenced by [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s [[Zettelkasten]].

Other thoughts

- Talahardin uses two inboxes: the writing inbox (general) and project inbox.
- Elements of PARA can be implemented too.

To do

- You can actually develop this system by going back to your workshop on life management system
