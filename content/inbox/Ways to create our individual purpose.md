[[Existential events or crises compel us to think about purpose]]. When we are at that point, [[We create our individual purpose]] using the following ways:

1. We reinterpret something in our life and elevate its value to another level. For example, we see our family differently and treat them as our ultimate reason for living.
2. We search for meaning. We feel like meaning is something we don’t yet have and must find it first. We do not have a meaningful life until we find it.
3. We still think that something outside ourselves bring meaning to our lives, but this pursuit towards it also gives meaning and sometimes is even more important ([[The journey is the reward]]).

Whatever we do to find meaning, the key here is that when we need it, we look for it somewhere. We are not born with it ([[thoughts/there is no destiny]]). Even if we claim that the universe “gives" us meaning (highly unlikely, because [[There is no single purpose everyone must follow]]), the truth is that our minds create the meaning. It is what interprets what it senses.

**To Do**

- Once its note has been developed, connect here the idea that we create our purpose by trying different things out.
