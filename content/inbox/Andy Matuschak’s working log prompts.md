# Andy Matuschak’s working log prompts

Here are the questions that [[Andy Matuschak]] asks himself every morning when he turns to working from his Evergreen notes to his Working Log.

- What are the most important unknowns for this project?
- What new ideas am I excited about?
- What are the most interesting things I know about this project?

According to Andy, if these prompts are not fruitful, he interprets this as:

- My inputs aren't high-variance enough.
- I’m not giving myself the right kind of creative space.
- I need to re-evaluate my projects.
