# Active Recall Testing

*Active recall testing* means being asked a question and trying to remember the answer. This is in contrast to *passive study*, where we read, watch, or listen to something without pausing to consider if we know the answer. Research has shown that active recall testing is far more effective at building strong memories than passive study. There are two reasons for this:

- The act of recalling something *strengthens* the memory, increasing the chances we’ll be able to remember it again.
- When we're unable to answer a question, it tells us we need to return to the material to review or relearn it.

A good way to integrate active recall testing into your own studies is to use *flashcards*.
