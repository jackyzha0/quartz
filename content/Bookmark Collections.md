I collect bookmarks in [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/). A subsection of these is curated and published to my Raindrop [public page](https://raindrop.io/SemanticData). Currently, I have these public collections available:

- Articles
    Blog posts or new articles I'd like to read more later.
- GitHub Repos
    Interesting repositories I'd like to learn more about.
- Guides
	- Bash Basics (series)
	- Rust Basics (series)
	- Terminal Basics (series)
- Hacker News
    HN links to threads I want to revisit in the future.
- Wikipedia
    My collection of Wikipedia articles. I pull directly from here to populate my "Links of the Day".
- Wishlist
    Small personal wishlist.
