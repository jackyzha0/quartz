## The right hemisphere is responsible for our capacity for emotional understanding # 

The [[right hemisphere]] has by far the preponderance of emotional understanding. It is the mediator of social behavior. In the absence of the [[right hemisphere]], the [[left hemisphere]] is unconcerned about others and their feelings. Social intercourse is conducted with a blanket disregard for the feelings, wishes, needs and expectations of others. Patients with deficits in the right [[orbitofrontal cortex]], but not left, suffer a change of personality whereby they become incapable of empathy. I believe this is because [[the right hemisphere sees things in their context]] and thus understands our dependence on the rest of species and it’s need to protect it.
