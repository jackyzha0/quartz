Introduction

24

The object of this study is the condition of knowledge in the most  
highly developed societies. I have decided to use the wordpost-modernto describe that condition. The word is in current use on the  
American continent among sociologists and critics; it designates  
the state of our culture foEowing the transformations which, since the  
end of the nineteenth century, have altered the game rules for  
science, literature, and the arts. The present study will place these  
transformations in the context of the crisis of narrative

24

Science has always been in conflict with narratives. Judged by the  
yardstick of science, the majority of them prove to be fables. But to  
the extent that science does not restrict itself to stating useful  
regularities and seeks the truth, it is obliged to legitimate the rules of  
its own game. It then produces a discourse of legitimation with  
respect to its own status, a discourse called philosophy. I will use the  
termmodernto designate any science that legitimates itself with  
reference to a metadiscourse of this kind making an explicit appeal  
to some grand narrative, such as the dialectics of Spirit, the her-meneutics of meaning, the emancipation of the rational or working  
subject, or the creation of wealt

24

. For example, the rule of consensus  
between the sender and addressee of a statement with truth-value is  
deemed acceptable if it is cast in terms of a possible unanimity be-tween rational minds: this is the Enlightenment narrative, in which  
xxiiixxiv G INTRODUCTION  
the hero of knowledge works toward a good ethico-political end   
—universal peace. As can be seen from this example, if a metanarrative  
implying a philosophy of history is used to legitimate knowledge,  
questions are raised concerning the validity of the institutions govern-ing the social bond: these must be legitimated as well. Thus justice is  
consigned to the grand narrative in the same way as truth.

25

Simplifying to the extreme, I definepostmodernas incredulity  
toward metanarratives. This incredulity is undoubtedly a product  
of progress in the sciences: but that progress in turn presupposes it.  
To the obsolescence of the metanarrative apparatus of legitimation  
corresponds, most notably, the crisis of metaphysical philosophy  
and of the university institution which in the past relied on it. The  
narrative function is losing its functors, its great hero, its great  
dangers, its great voyages, its great goal. It is being dispersed in  
clouds of narrative language elements—narrative, but also denotative,  
prescriptive, descriptive, and so on. Conveyed within each cloud are  
pragmatic valencies specific to its kind. Each of us lives at the inter-section of many of these. However, we do not necessarily establish  
stable language combinations, and the properties of the ones we do  
establish are not necessarily communicabl

25

Thus the society of the future falls less within the province of   
aNewtonian anthropology (such as stucturalism or systems theory)  
than a pragmatics of language particles. There are many different  
language games—a heterogeneity of elements. They only give rise to  
institutions in patches—local determinis

25

The decision makers, however, attempt to manage these clouds of  
sociality according to input/output matrices, following a logic which  
implies that their elements are commensurable and that the whole is  
determinable. They allocate our lives for the growth of power. In  
matters of social justice and of scientific truth alike, the legitimation  
of that power is based on its optimizing the system's performance   
—efficiency. The application of this criterion to all of our games neces-sarily entails a certain level of terror, whether soft or hard: be opera-tional (that is, commensurable) or disappear.

25

The logic of maximum performance is no doubt inconsistent in  
many ways, particularly with respect to contradiction in the socio-economic field: it demands both less work (to lower production  
costs) and more (to lessen the social burden of the idle population).  
But our incredulity is now such that we no longer expect salvation to  
rise from these inconsistencies, as did Marx.

25

Still, the postmodern condition is as much a stranger to disenchant-ment as it is to the blind positivity of delegitimation. Where, afterINTRODUCTION D xxv  
the metanarratives, can legitimacy reside? The operativity criterion  
is technological; it has no relevance for judging what is true or just.  
Is legitimacy to be found in consensus obtained through discussion,  
as Ju'rgen Habermas thinks? Such consensus does violence to the  
heterogeneity of language games. And invention is always born of  
dissension. Postmodern knowledge is not simply a tool of the author-ities; it refines our sensitivity to differences and reinforces our ability  
to tolerate the incommensurable. Its principle is not the expert's  
homology, but the inventor's paralogy.

26

Here is the question: is a legitimation of the social bond, a just  
society, feasible in terms of a paradox analogous to that of scientific  
activity? What would such a paradox be?

26

It remains to be said that the author of the report is a philosopher,  
not an expert. The latter knows what he knows and what he does not  
know: the former does no

30

Our working hypothesis is that the status of knowledge is altered as  
societies enter what is known as the postindustrial age and cultures  
enter what is known as the postmodern age.1  
This transition has been  
under way since at least the end of the 1950s, which for Europe  
marks the completion of reconstructio

30

Rather than painting a picture that would inevitably remain in-complete, I will take as my point of departure a single feature, one  
that immediately defines our object of study. Scientific knowledge is  
a kind of discourse. And it is fair to say that for the last forty years  
the "leading" sciences and technologies have had to do with language:  
phonology and theories of linguistics,4  
problems of communication  
and cybernetics,5  
modern theories of algebra and informatics,6  
computers and their languages,7  
problems of translation and the  
search for areas of compatibility among computer languages,8  
prob-lems of information storage and data banks,9  
telematics and the  
34 D THE POSTMODERN CONDITION  
perfection of intelligent terminals,10  
paradoxology.11  
The facts  
speak for themselves (and this list is not exhaustive).

31

These technological transformations can be expected to have   
aconsiderable impact on knowledge. Its two principal functions   
—research and the transmission of acquired learning—are already feel-ing the effect, or will in the futur

31

, it is common knowledge that  
the miniaturization and commercialization of machines is already  
changing the way in which learning is acquired, classified, made avail-able, and exploited.12  
It is reasonable to suppose that the prolifera-tion of information-processing machines is having, and will continue  
to have, as much of an effect on the circulation of learning as did ad-vancements in human circulation (transportation systems) and later,  
in the circulation of sounds and visual images (the media).13

31

The nature of knowledge cannot survive unchanged within this  
context of general transformation. It can fit into the new channels,  
and become operational, only if learning is translated into quantities  
of information.14  
We can predict that anything in the constituted  
body of knowledge that is not translatable in this way will be aban-doned and that the direction of new research will be dictated by the  
possibility of its eventual results being translatable into computer  
language. The "producers" and users of knowledge must now, and  
will have to, possess the means of translating into these languages  
whatever they want to invent or learn. Research on translating  
machines is already well advanced.15  
Along with the hegemony of  
computers comes a certain logic, and therefore a certain set of pre-scriptions determining which statements are accepted as "knowledge"  
statements.

31

We may thus expect a thorough exteriorization of knowledge with  
respect to the "knower," at whatever point he or she may occupy in  
the knowledge process. The old principle that the acquisition of  
knowledge is indissociable from the training(Bildung)of minds, or  
even of individuals, is becoming obsolete and will become ever more  
so. The relationship of the suppliers and users of knowledge to the  
knowledge they supply and use is now tending, and will increasingly  
tend, to assume the form already taken by the relationship of com-modity producers and consumers to the commodities they produce  
and consume—that is, the form of value. Knowledge is and will be  
produced in order to be sold, it is and will be consumed in order to  
be valorized in a new production: in both cases, the goal is exchange.THEPOSTMODERNCONDITION D   
5Knowledge ceases to be an end in itself, it loses its "use-value."16

32

It is widely accepted that knowledge has become the principle  
force of production over the last few decades;17  
this has already had  
a noticeable effect on the composition of the work force of the most  
highlydevelopedcountries18  
ndconstitutesthemajorbottleneck  
for the developing countries. In the postindustrial and postmodern  
age, science will maintain and no doubt strengthen its preeminence in  
the arsenal of productive capacities of the nation-states. Indeed, this  
situation is one of the reasons leading to the conclusion that the gap  
between developed and developing countries will grow ever wider in  
the future.19  
But this aspect of the problem should not be allowed to over-shadow the other, which is complementary to it. Knowledge in the  
form of an informational commodity indispensable to productive  
power is already, and will continue to be, a major—perhapsthe  
major—stake in the worldwide competition for power. It is conceiv-able that the nation-states will one day fight for control of informa-tion, just as they battled in the past for control over territory, and  
afterwards for control of access to and exploitation of raw materials  
and cheap labor. A new field is opened for industrial and commercial  
strategiesontheonehand,and political and military strategies on  
the other.20

32

However, the perspective I have outlined above is not as simple as  
I have made it appear. For the mercantilization of knowledge is  
bound to affect the privilege the nation-states have enjoyed, and still  
enjoy, with respect to the production and distribution of learning.  
The notion that learning falls within the purview of the State, as the  
brain or mind of society, will become more and more outdated with  
the increasing strength of the opposing principle, according to which  
society exists and progresses only if the messages circulating within  
it are rich in information and easy to decode. The ideology of com-municational "transparency," which goes hand in hand with the  
commercialization of knowledge, will begin to perceive the State as  
a factor of opacity and "noise." It is from this point of view that  
the problem of the relationship between economic and State powers  
threatens to arise with a new urgency.

32

Already in the last few decades, economic powers have reached  
the point of imperiling the stability of the State through new forms  
of the circulation of capital that go by the generic name ofmulti-national corporations.These new forms of circulation imply that  
investment decisions have, at least in part, passed beyond the control  
of the nation-states.21  
The question threatens to become even more6 O THE POSTMODERN CONDITION  
thorny with the development of computer technology and telematic

33

Suppose, for example, that a firm such as IBM is authorized to occupy  
a belt in the earth's orbital field and launch communications satel-lites or satellites housing data banks. Who will have access to them?  
Who will determine which channels or data are forbidden? The  
State? Or will the State simply be one user among others? New legal  
issues will be raised, and with them the question: "who will know?"

33

Transformation in the nature of knowledge, then, could well have  
repercussions on the existing public powers, forcing them to recon-sider their relations (both de jure and de facto) with the large corpor-ations and, more generally, with civil society. The reopening of the  
world market, a return to vigorous economic competition, the break-down of the hegemony of American capitalism, the decline of the  
socialist alternative, a probable opening of the Chinese market   
—these and many other factors are already, at the end of the 1970s,  
preparing States for a serious reappraisal of the role they have been  
accustomed to playing since the 1930s: that of guiding, or even  
directing investments.In this light, the new technologies can only  
increase the urgency of such a reexamination, since they make the  
information used in decision making (and therefore the means of  
control) even more mobile and subject to piracy.

33

It is not hard to visualize learning circulating along the same lines  
as money, instead of for its "educational" value or political (adminis-trative, diplomatic, military) importance; the pertinent distinction  
would no longer be between knowledge and ignorance, but rather, as  
is the case with money, between "payment knowledge" and "invest-ment knowledge"—in other words, between units of knowledge ex-changed in a daily maintenance framework (the reconstitution of the  
work force, "survival") versus funds of knowledge dedicated to  
optimizing the performance of a project.

30

1. The Field: Knowledge in Computerized Societies

33

If this were the case, communicational transparency would be  
similar to liberalism. Liberalism does not preclude an organization  
of the flow of money in which some channels are used in decision  
making while others are only good for the payment of debts. One  
could similarly imagine flows of knowledge traveling along identical  
channels of identical nature, some of which would be reserved for  
the "decision makers," while the others would be used to repay each  
person's perpetual debt with respect to the social bond.

34

ndalreadyguidingcertaindecisionsbythe  
governmental agencies and private firms most directly concerned,  
such as those managing the telecommunications industry. To some  
extent, then, it is already a part of observable realit

34

This is as much as to say that the hypothesis is banal. But only to  
the extent that it fails to challenge the general paradigm of progress  
in science and technology, to which economic growth and the expan-sion of sociopolitical power seem to be natural complements. That  
scientific and technical knowledge is cumulative is never questioned.  
At most, what is debated is the form that accumulation takes—some  
picture it as regular, continuous, and unanimous, others as periodic,  
discontinuous, and conflictual.24

34

But these truisms are fallacious. In the first place, scientific know-ledge does not represent the totality of knowledge; it has always  
existed in addition to, and in competition and conflict with, another  
kind of knowledge, which I will call narrative in the interests of  
simplicity (its characteristics will be described later). I do not mean  
to say that narrative knowledge can prevail over science, but its  
modelisrelatedtoideasofinternalequilibriumandconviviality25  
next to which contemporary scientific knowledge cuts a poor figure,  
especially if it is to undergo an exteriorization with respect to the  
"knower" and an alienation from its user even greater than has  
previously been the case. The resulting demoralization of researchers  
and teachers is far from negligible; it is well known that during the  
1960s, in all of the most highly developed societies, it reached such8 Q THE POSTMODERN CONDITION  
explosive dimensions among those preparing to practice these profes-sions—the students —that there was noticeable decrease in productiv-ity at laboratories and universities unable to protect themselves from  
its contamination.26  
Expecting this, with hope or fear, to lead to   
arevolution (as was then often the case) is out of the question: it will  
not change the order of things in postindustrial society overnight.  
But this doubt on the part of scientists must be taken into account as  
a major factor in evaluating the present and future status of scientific  
knowledge.

35

It is all the more necessary to take it into consideration since—and  
this is the second point—the scientists' demoralization has an impact  
on the central problem of legitimation. I use the word in a broader  
sense than do contemporary German theorists in their discussions of  
the question of authority.Take any civil law as an example: it  
states that a given category of citizens must perform a specific kind  
of action. Legitimation is the process by which a legislator is author-ized to promulgate such a law as a norm. Now take the example of   
ascientific statement: it is subject to the rule that a statement must  
fulfill a given set of conditions in order to be accepted as scientific.  
In this case, legitimation is the process by which a "legislator" deal-ing with scientific discourse is authorized to prescribe the stated  
conditions (in general, conditions of internal consistency and experi-mental verification) determining whether a statement is to be included  
in that discourse for consideration by the scientific community.

35

The parallel may appear forced. But as we will see, it is not. The  
question of the legitimacy of science has been indissociably linked to  
that of the legitimation of the legislator since the time of Plato.  
From this point of view, the right to decide what is true is not inde-pendent of the right to decide what is just, even if the statements  
consigned to these two authorities differ in nature. The point is that  
there is a strict interlinkage between the kind of language called  
science and the kind called ethics and politics: they both stem from  
the same perspective, the same "choice" if you will—the choice  
called the Occident.

35

When we examine the current status of scientific knowledge—at   
atime when science seems more completely subordinated to the pre-vailing powers than ever before and, along with the new technologies,  
is in danger of becoming a major stake in their conflicts—the ques-tion of double legitimation, far from receding into the background,  
necessarily comes to the fore. For it appears in its most complete  
form, that of reversion, revealing that knowledge and power areTHE POSTMODERN CONDITION D   
9simply two sides of the same question: who decides what knowledge  
is, and who knows what needs to be decided? In the computer age,  
the question of knowledge is now more than ever a question of  
government.

36

3. The Method: Language Games

36

The reader will already have noticed that in analyzing this problem  
within the framework set forth I have favored a certain procedure:  
emphasizing facts of language and in particular their pragmatic as-pect.28  
To help clarify what follows it would be useful to summarize,  
however briefly, what is meant here by the termp  
ragmati

36

Adenotativeutterance29  
uchas"The university is sick," made in  
the context of a conversation or an interview, positions its sender  
(the person who utters the statement), its addressee (the person who  
receives it), and its referent (what the statement deals with) in   
aspecific way: the utterance places (and exposes) the sender in the  
position of "knower"(he knows what the situation is with the univer-sity), the addressee is put in the position of having to give or refuse  
his assent, and the referent itself is handled in a way unique to  
denotatives, as something that demands to be correctly identified  
and expressed by the statement that refers to it.

36

If we consider a declaration such as "The university is open,"  
pronounced by a dean or rector at convocation, it is clear that the  
previous specifications no longer apply. Of course, the meaning of  
the utterance has to be understood, but that is a general condition  
of communication and does not aid us in distinguishing the differ-ent kinds of utterances or their specific effects. The distinctive  
feature of this second, "performative,"30  
utterance is that its effect  
upon the referent coincides with its enunciation. The university is  
open because it has been declared open in the above-mentioned  
circumstances. That this is so is not subject to discussion or verifica-tion on the part of the addressee, who is immediately placed within  
the new context created by the utterance. As for the sender, he must  
be invested with the authority to make such a statement. Actually,  
we could say it the other way around: the sender is dean or rector—  
that is, he is invested with the authority to make this kind of state-ment—only insofar as he can directly affect both the referent, (the  
university) and the addressee (the university staff) in the manner   
Ihave indicate

36

A different case involves utterances of the type, "Give money to10 D THE POSTMODERN CONDITION  
the university"; these are prescriptions. They can be modulated as  
orders, commands, instructions, recommendations, requests, prayers,  
pleas, etc. Here, the sender is clearly placed in a position of authority,  
using the term broadly (including the authority of a sinner over a god  
who claims to be merciful): that is, he expects the addressee to per-form the action referred to. The pragmatics of prescription entail  
concomitant changes in the posts of addressee and referent.31

37

Of a different order again is the efficiency of a question, a promise,  
a literary description, a narration, etc. I am summarizing. Wittgen-stein, taking up the study of language again from scratch, focuses his  
attention on the effects of different modes of discourse; he calls the  
various types of utterances he identifies along the way (a few of  
which I have listed)anguage   
games.32Whathemeansbythisterm  
that each of the various categories of utterance can be defined in  
terms of rules specifying their properties and the uses to which they  
can be put—in exactly the same way as the game of chess is defined  
by a set of rules determining the properties of each of the pieces, in  
other words, the proper way to move the

37

It is useful to make the following three observations about lan-guage games. The first is that their rules do not carry within them-selves their own legitimation, but are the object of a contract, explicit  
or not, between players (which is not to say that the players invent  
the rules). The second is that if there are no rules, there is no game,33  
that even an infinitesimal modification of one rule alters the nature  
of the game, that a "move" or utterance that does not satisfy the  
rules does not belong to the game they define. The third remark is  
suggested by what has just been said: every utterance should be  
thought of as a "move" in a game.

37

This last observation brings us to the first principle underlying our  
method as a whole: to speak is to fight, in the sense of playing, and  
s  
peechacts34fallwithinthedomainofageneralagonistics.35 Thidoes not necessarily mean that one plays in order to win. A move can  
be made for the sheer pleasure of its invention: what else is involved  
in that labor of language harassment undertaken by popular speech  
and by literature? Great joy is had in the endless invention of turns  
of phrase, of words and meanings, the process behind the evolution  
of language on the level ofparole.But undoubtedly even this plea-sure depends on a feeling of success won at the expense of an adver-sary—at least one adversary, and a formidable one: the accepted  
language, or connotation.36

37

This idea of an agonistics of language should not make us lose  
sight of the second principle, which stands as a complement to itTHE POSTMODERN CONDITION O 11  
and governs our analysis: that the observable social bond is com-posed of language "moves." An elucidation of this proposition will  
take us to the heart of the matter at hand.

38

4. The Nature of the Social Bond: The Modern Alternative

38

If we wish to discuss knowledge in the most highly developed con-temporary society, we must answer the preliminary question of what  
methodological representation to apply to that society. Simplifying  
to the extreme, it is fair to say that in principle there have been, at  
least over the last half-century, two basic representational models for  
society: either society forms a functional whole, or it is divided in  
two. An illustration of the first model is suggested by Talcott Parsons  
(at least the postwar Parsons) and his school, and of the second, by  
the Marxist current (all of its component schools, whatever differ-ences they may have, accept both the principle of class struggle and  
dialectics as a duality operating within society).37

38

This methodological split, which defines two major kinds of dis-course on society, has been handed down from the nineteenth  
century. The idea that society forms an organic whole, in the absence  
of which it ceases to be a society (and sociology ceases to have an  
object of study), dominated the minds of the founders of the French  
school. Added detail was supplied by functionalism; it took yet  
another turn in the 1950s with Parsons's conception of society as   
aself-regulating system. The theoretical and even material model is  
no longer the living organism; it is provided by cybernetics, which,  
during and after the Second World War, expanded the model's  
applications.

38

In Parsons's work, the principle behind the system is still, if   
Imay say so, optimistic: it corresponds to the stabilization of the  
growth economies and societies of abundance under the aegis of   
amoderate welfare state.38  
In the work of contemporary German  
theorists,systemtheorieis technocratic, even cynical, not to men-tion despairing: the harmony between the needs and hopes of  
individuals or groups and the functions guaranteed by the system is  
now only a secondary component of its functioning. The true goal  
of the system, the reason it programs itself like a computer, is the  
optimization of the global relationship between input and output   
—in other words, performativity. Even when its rules are in the process  
of changing and innovations are occurring, even when its dysfunc-tions (such as strikes, crises, unemployment, or political revolutions)  
inspire hope and lead to belief in an alternative, even then what is12 D THE POSTMODERN CONDITION  
actually taking place is only an internal readjustment, and its result  
can be no more than an increase in the system's "viability." The only  
alternative to this kind of performance improvement is entropy, or  
decline.39

39

Here again, while avoiding the simplifications inherent in a sociol-ogy of social theory, it is difficult to deny at least a parallel between  
this "hard" technocratic version of society and the ascetic effort that  
was demanded (the fact that it was done in name of "advanced  
liberalism" is beside the point) of the most highly developed industrial  
societies in order to make them competitive—and thus optimize their  
"rationality"—within the framework of the resumption of economic  
world war in the 1960s.

39

Even taking into account the massive displacement intervening be-tween the thought of a man like Comte and the thought of Luhmann,  
we can discern a common conception of the social: society is a uni-fied totality, a "unicity." Parsons formulates this clearly: "The most  
essential condition of successful dynamic analysis is a continual and  
systematic reference of every problem to the state of the system as   
awhole. ... A process or set of conditions either 'contributes' to the  
maintenance (or development) of the system or it is 'dysfunctional'  
in that it detracts from the integration, effectiveness, etc., of the  
system."40  
The "technocrats41  
alsosubscribetothisidea.Whence  
its credibility: it has the means to become a reality, and that is all  
the proof it needs. This is what Horkheimer called the "paranoia" of  
reason.42

39

But this realism of systemic self-regulation, and this perfectly  
sealed circle of facts and interpretations, can be judged paranoid only  
if one has, or claims to have, at one's disposal a viewpoint that is in  
principle immune from their allure. This is the function of the prin-ciple of class struggle in theories of society based on the work of  
Marx.

39

"Traditional" theory is always in danger of being incorporated  
into the programming of the social whole as a simple tool for the  
optimization of its performance; this is because its desire for a uni-tary and totalizing truth lends itself to the unitary and totalizing  
practice of the system's managers. "Critical" theory,43  
based on   
aprinciple of dualism and wary of syntheses and reconciliations,  
should be in a position to avoid this fate. What guides Marxism, then,  
is a different model of society, and a different conception of the  
function of the knowledge that can be produced by society and  
acquired from it. This model was born of the struggles accompanying  
the process of capitalism's encroachment upon traditional civilTHE POSTMODERN CONDITION D 13  
societies. There is insufficient space here to chart the vicissitudes of  
these struggles, which fill more than a century of social, political, and  
ideological history. We will have to content ourselves with a glance at  
the balance sheet, which is possible for us to tally today now that  
their fate is known: in countries with liberal or advanced liberal  
management, the struggles and their instruments have been trans-formed into regulators of the system; in communist countries, the  
totalizing model and its totalitarian effect have made a comeback in  
the name of Marxism itself, and the struggles in question have simply  
been deprived of the right to exist.44  
Everywhere, the Critique of  
political economy (the subtitle of Marx'sCapital)and its correlate,  
the critique of alienated society, are used in one way or another as  
aids in programming the system.45

40

Of course, certain minorities, such as the Frankfurt School or the  
group Socialisme ou barbarie,46 preserved and refined the critical  
model in opposition to this process. But the social foundation of the  
principle of division, or class struggle, was blurred to the point of  
losing all of its radicality; we cannot conceal the fact that the critical  
model in the end lost its theoretical standing and was reduced to the  
status of a "utopia" or "hope,"47  
a token protest raised in the name  
of man or reason or creativity, or again of some social category   
—suchastheThirdWorldorthestudents48—on which is conferred in  
extremis the henceforth improbable function of critical subject.

40

The sole purpose of this schematic (or skeletal) reminder has been  
to specify the problematic in which I intend to frame the question of  
knowledge in advanced industrial societies. For it is impossible to  
know what the state of knowledge is—in other words, the problems  
its development and distribution are facing today—without knowing  
something of the society within which it is situated. And today more  
than ever, knowing about that society involves first of all choosing  
what approach the inquiry will take, and that necessarily means  
choosing how society can answer. One can decide that the principal  
role of knowledge is as an indispensable element in the functioning  
of society, and act in accordance with that decision, only if one has  
already decided that society is a giant machine.49

40

Conversely, one can count on its critical function, and orient its  
development and distribution in that direction, only after it has been  
decided that society does not form an integrated whole, but remains  
haunted by a principle of opposition.50  
The alternative seems clear:  
it is a choice between the homogeneity and the intrinsic duality of  
the social, between functional and critical knowledge. But the deci-sion seems difficult, or arbitrary.

41

It is tempting to avoid the decision altogether by distinguishing  
two kinds of knowledge. One, the positivist kind, would be directly  
applicable to technologies bearing on men and materials, and would  
lend itself to operating as an indispensable productive force within  
the system. The other—the critical, reflexive, or hermeneutic kind   
—by reflecting directly or indirectly on values or aims, would resist any  
such "recuperation."51

5. The Nature of the Social Bond:  
The Postmodern Perspecti

41

I find this partition solution unacceptable. I suggest that the alterna-tive it attempts to resolve, but only reproduces, is no longer relevant  
for the societies with which we are concerned and that the solution  
itself is still caught within a type of oppositional thinking that is out  
of step with the most vital modes of postmodern knowledge. As   
Ihave already said, economic "redeployment" in the current phase of  
capitalism, aided by a shift in techniques and technology, goes hand  
in hand with a change in the function of the State: the image of soci-ety this syndrome suggests necessitates a serious revision of the alter-nate approaches considered. For brevity's sake, suffice it to say that  
functions of regulation, and therefore of reproduction, are being and  
will be further withdrawn from administrators and entrusted to  
machines. Increasingly, the central question is becoming who will  
have access to the information these machines must have in storage  
to guarantee that the right decisions are made. Access to data is, and  
will continue to be, the prerogative of experts of all stripes. The rul-ing class is and will continue to be the class of decision makers. Even  
now it is no longer composed of the traditional political class, but  
of a composite layer of corporate leaders, high-level administrators,  
and the heads of the major professional, labor, political, and religious  
organizations.52

41

What is new in all of this is that the old poles of attraction repre-sented by nation-states, parties, professions, institutions, and histori-cal traditions are losing their attraction. And it does not look as  
though they will be replaced, at least not on their former scale. The  
Trilateral Commission is not a popular pole of attraction. "Identify-ing" with the great names, the heroes of contemporary history, is  
becoming more and more difficult.53  
Dedicating oneself to "catching  
up with Germany," the life goal the French president [Giscard  
d'Estaing at the time this book was published in France] seems to  
be offering his countrymen, is not exactly exicting. But then again,THE POSTMODERN CONDITION D 15  
it is not exactly a life goal. It depends on each individual's industri-ousness. Each individual is referred to himself. And each of us knows  
that ourselfdoes not amount to much.54

42

This breaking up of the grand Narratives (discussed below, sections  
9 and 10) leads to what some authors analyze in terms of the dissolu-tion of the social bond and the disintegration of social aggregates  
into a mass of individual atoms thrown into the absurdity of Brownian  
motion.55  
Nothing of the kind is happening: this point of view, it  
seems to me, is haunted by the paradisaic representation of a lost  
"organic" society.

42

Aselfdoes not amount to much, but no self is an island; each  
exists in a fabric of relations that is now more complex and mobile  
than ever before. Young or old, man or woman, rich or poor, a per-son is always located at "nodal points" of specific communication  
circuits, however tiny these may be.56  
Or better: one is always  
located at a post through which various kinds of messages pass. No  
one, not even the least privileged among us, is ever entirely powerless  
over the messages that traverse and position him at the post of sender,  
addressee, or referent. One's mobility in relation to these language  
game effects (language games, of course, are what this is all about)  
is tolerable, at least within certain limits (and the limits are vague);  
it is even solicited by regulatory mechanisms, and in particular by  
the self-adjustments the system undertakes in order to improve its  
performance. It may even be said that the system can and must  
encourage such movement to the extent that it combats its own  
entropy; the novelty of an unexpected "move," with its correlative  
displacement of a partner or group of partners, can supply the  
system with that increased performativity it forever demands and  
consumes.57

42

It should now be clear from which perspective I chose language  
games as my general methodological approach. I am not claiming  
t  
hat the entirety of social relations is of this nature—that will remainan open question. But there is no need to resort to some fiction of  
social origins to establish that language games are the minimum rela-tion required for society to exist: even before he is born, if only by  
virtue of the name he is given, the human child is already positioned  
as the referent in the story recounted by those around him, in rela-tion to which he will inevitably chart his course.58  
Or more simply  
still, the question of the social bond, insofar as it is a question, is  
itself a language game, the game of inquiry. It immediately positions  
the person who asks, as well as the addressee and the referent asked  
about: it is already the social bond.

43

On the other hand, in a society whose communication component  
is becoming more prominent day by day, both as a reality and as an  
issue,59  
it is clear that language assumes a new importance. It would  
be superficial to reduce its significance to the traditional alternative  
between manipulatory speech and the unilateral transmission of mes-sages on the one hand, and free expression and dialogue on the othe

43

A word on this last point. If the problem is described simply in  
terms of communication theory, two things are overlooked: first,  
messages have quite different forms and effects depending on whether  
they are, for example, denotatives, prescriptives, evaluatives, per-formatives, etc. It is clear that what is important is not simply the  
fact that they communicate information. Reducing them to this  
function is to adopt an outlook which unduly privileges the system's  
own interests and point of view. A cybernetic machine does indeed  
run on information, but the goals programmed into it, for example,  
originate in prescriptive and evaluative statements it has no way to  
correct in the course of its functioning—for example, maximizing  
its own performance. How can one guarantee that performance  
maximization is the best goal for the social system in every case? In  
any case the "atoms" forming its matter are competent to handle  
statements such as these—and this question in particula

43

Second, the trivial cybernetic version of information theory misses  
something of decisive importance, to which I have already called at-tention: the agonistic aspect of society. The atoms are placed at the  
crossroads of pragmatic relationships, but they are also displaced by  
the messages that traverse them, in perpetual motion. Each language  
partner, when a "move" pertaining to him is made, undergoes   
a"displacement," an alteration of some kind that not only affects him  
in his capactiy as addressee and referent, but also as sender. These  
"moves" necessarily provoke "countermoves" —and everyone knows  
that a countermove that is merely reactional is not a "good" move.  
Reactional countermoves are no more than programmed effects in  
the opponent's strategy; they play into his hands and thus have no  
effect on the balance of power. That is why it is important to increase  
displacement in the games, and even to disorient it, in such a way as  
to make an unexpected "move" (a new statement).

43

What is needed if we are to understand social relations in this  
manner, on whatever scale we choose, is not only a theory of com-munication, but a theory of games which accepts agonistics as   
afounding principle. In this context, it is easy to see that the essential  
element of newness is not simply "innovation." Support for this ap-proach can be found in the work of a number of contemporaryTHE POSTMODERN CONDITION D 17  
sociologists,60  
in addition to linguists and philosophers of languag

44

This "atomization" of the social into flexible networks of lan-guage games may seem far removed from the modern reality, which  
is depicted, on the contrary, as afflicted with bureaucratic paraly-sis.61  
The objection will be made, at least, that the weight of certain  
institutions imposes limits on the games, and thus restricts the in-ventiveness of the players in making their moves. But I think this can  
be taken into account without causing any particular difficult

44

In the ordinary use of discourse—for example, in a discussion  
between two friends—the interlocutors use any available ammuni-tion, changing games from one utterance to the next: questions,  
requests, assertions, and narratives are launched pell-mell into battle.  
The war is not without rules,62  
but the rules allow and encourage the  
greatest possible flexibility of utteranc

44

From this point of view, an institution differs from a conversation  
in that it always requires supplementary constraints for statements to  
be declared admissible within its bounds. The constraints function to  
filter discursive potentials, interrupting possible connections in the  
communication networks: there are things that should not be said.  
They also privilege certain classes of statements (sometimes only  
one) whose predominance characterizes the discourse of the parti-cular institution: there are things that should be said, and there are  
ways of saying them. Thus: orders in the army, prayer in church,  
denotation in the schools, narration in families, questions in philo-sophy, performativity in businesses. Bureaucratization is the outer  
limit of this tendency.

44

However, this hypothesis about the institution is still too "un-wieldy": its point of departure is an overly "reifying" view of what  
is institutionalized. We know today that the limits the institution im-poses on potential language "moves" are never established once and  
for all (even if they have been formally defined).63  
Rather, the limits  
are themselves the stakes and provisional results of language strate-gies, within the institution and without. Examples: Does the univer-sity have a place for language experiments (poetics)? Can you tell  
stories in a cabinet meeting? Advocate a cause in the barracks? The  
answers are clear: yes, if the university opens creative workshops;  
yes, if the cabinet works with prospective scenarios; yes, if the limits  
of the old institution are displaced.64  
Reciprocally, it can be said that  
the boundaries only stabilize when they cease to be stakes in the  
game.  
This, I think, is the appropriate approach to contemporary institu-tions of knowledge.

6. The Pragmatics of Narrative Knowled

45

In Section 1, I leveled two objections against the unquestioning ac-ceptance of an instrumental conception of knowledge in the most  
highly developed societies. Knowledge is not the same as science, es-pecially in its contemporary form; and science, far from successfully  
obscuring the problem of its legitimacy, cannot avoid raising it with  
all of its implications, which are no less sociopolitical than episte-mological. Let us begin with an analysis of the nature of "narrative"  
knowledge; by providing a point of comparison, our examination will  
clarify at least some of the characteristics of the form assumed by  
scientific knowledge in contemporary society. In addition, it will aid  
us in understanding how the question of legitimacy is raised or fails  
to be raised toda

45

Knowledge [savoir] in general cannot be reduced to science, nor  
even to learning[connaissance] .Learning is the set of statements  
which, to the exclusion of all other statements, denote or describe  
objects and may be declared true or false.65  
Science is a subset of  
learning. It is also composed of denotative statements, but imposes  
two supplementary conditions on their acceptability: the objects to  
which they refer must be available for repeated access, in other  
words, they must be accessible in explicit conditions of observation;  
and it must be possible to decide whether or not a given statement  
pertains to the language judged relevant by the experts.66

45

B  
ut what is meant by the term knowledge is not only a set ofdenotative statements, far from it. It also includes notions of "know-how," "knowing how to live," "how to listen" [savoir-faire, savoir-vivre, savoir-ecouter] , etc. Knowledge, then, is a question of compe-tence that goes beyond the simple determination and application of  
the criterion of truth, extending to the determination and applica-tion of criteria of efficiency (technical qualification), of justice and/  
or happiness (ethical wisdom), of the beauty of a sound or color  
(auditory and visual sensibility), etc. Understood in this way, know-ledge is what makes someone capable of forming "good" denotative  
utterances, but also "good" prescriptive and "good" evaluative  
utterances. ... It is not a competence relative to a particular class  
of statements (for example, cognitive ones) to the exclusion of all  
others. On the contrary, it makes "good" performances in relation to  
a variety of objects of discourse possible: objects to be known, de-cided on, evaluated, transformed. . . . From this derives one of the  
principal features of knowledge: it coincides with an extensive arrayTHE POSTMODERN CONDITION Q 19  
of competence-building measures and is the only form embodied in  
a subject constituted by the various areas of competence composing  
it.

46

Another characteristic meriting special attention is the relation  
between this kind of knowledge and custom. What is a "good" pre-scriptive or evaluative utterance, a "good" performance in denotative  
or technical matters? They are all judged to be "good" because they  
conform to the relevant criteria (of justice, beauty, truth, and effi-ciency respectively) accepted in the social circle of the "knower's"  
interlocutors. The early philosophers called this mode of legitimating  
statements opinion.67  
The consensus that permits such knowledge to  
be circumscribed and makes it possible to distinguish one who knows  
from one who doesn't (the foreigner, the child) is what constitutes  
the culture of a people.68

46

This brief reminder of what knowledge can be in the way of train-ing and culture draws on ethnological description for its justifica-tion.69  
But anthropological studies and literature that take rapidly  
developing societies as their object can attest to the survival of this  
type of knowledge within them, at least in some of their sectors.70  
The very idea of development presupposes a horizon of nondevelop-ment where, it is assumed, the various areas of competence remain  
enveloped in the unity of a tradition and are not differentiated ac-cording to separate qualifications subject to specific innovations, de-bates, and inquiries. This opposition does not necessarily imply   
adifference in nature between "primitive" and "civilized" man,71  
but is compatible with the premise of a formal identity between "the  
savage mind" and scientific thought;72  
it is even compatible with the  
(apparently contrary) premise of the superiority of customary know-ledge over the contemporary dispersion of competence.73

46

It is fair to say that there is one point on which all of the investiga-tions agree, regardless of which scenario they propose to dramatize  
and understand the distance separating the customary state of know-ledge from its state in the scientific age: the preeminence of the  
narrative form in the formulation of traditional knowledge. Some  
study this form for its own sake;74  
others see it as the diachronic  
costume of the structural operators that, according to them, properly  
constitute the knowledge in question;75  
still others bring to it an  
"economic" interpretation in the Freudian sense of the term.76  
All  
that is important here is the fact that its form is narrative. Narration  
is the quintessential form of customary knowledge, in more ways  
than on

46

First, the popular stories themselves recount what could be called20 D THE POSTMODERN CONDITION  
positive or negative apprenticeships(Bildungen):in other words, the  
successes or failures greeting the hero's undertakings. These successes  
or failures either bestow legitimacy upon social institutions (the  
function of myths), or represent positive or negative models (the  
successful or unsuccessful hero) of integration into established insti-tutions (legends and tales). Thus the narratives allow the society in  
which they are told, on the one hand, to define its criteria of compe-tence and, on the other, to evaluate according to those criteria what  
is performed or can be performed within it.

47

Second, the narrative form, unlike the developed forms of the dis-course of knowledge, lends itself to a great variety of language games.  
Denotative statements concerning, for example, the state of the sky  
and the flora and fauna easily slip in; so do deontic statements pre-scribing what should be done with respect to these same referents, or  
with respect to kinship, the difference between the sexes, children,  
neighbors, foreigners, etc. Interrogative statements are implied, for  
example, in episodes involving challenges (respond to a question,  
choose one from a number of things); evaluative statements also  
enter in, etc. The areas of competence whose criteria the narrative  
supplies or applies are thus tightly woven together in the web it  
forms, ordered by the unified viewpoint characteristic of this kind of  
knowledge.

47

We shall examine in somewhat more detail a third property,  
which relates to the transmission of narratives. Their narration  
usually obeys rules that define the pragmatics of their transmission.   
Ido not mean to say that a given society institutionally assigns the  
role of narrator to certain categories on the basis of age, sex, or  
family or professional group. What I am getting at is a pragmatics of  
popular narratives that is, so to speak, intrinsic to them. For example,  
aCashinahua77  
torytelleralwaysbeginshisnarrationwithafixed  
formula: "Here is the story of—, as I've always heard it told. I will  
tell it to you in my turn. Listen." And he brings it to a close with  
another, also invariable, formula: "Here ends the story of—. The  
man who has told it to you is— (Cashinahua name), or to the  
Whites— (Spanish or Portuguese name)."78

47

A quick analysis of this double pragmatic instruction reveals the  
following: the narrator's only claim to competence for telling the  
story is the fact that he has heard it himself. The current narratee  
gains potential access to the same authority simply by listening. It is  
claimed that the narrative is a faithful transmission (even if the narra-tive performance is highly inventive) and that it has been told "for-ever": therefore the hero, a Cashinahuan, was himself once a narratee,THE POSTMODERN CONDITION D 21  
and perhaps a narrator, of the very same story. This similarity of con-dition allows for the possibility that the current narrator could be  
the hero of a narrative,just as the Ancestor was. In fact,he is necessarily  
such ahero because he bears a name,declined atthe end of his narration,  
and that name was given to him in conformity with the canonic narrative  
legitimating the assignment of patronyms among the Cashinahu

48

The pragmatic rule illustrated by this example cannot, of course,  
be universalized.79  
But it gives insight into what is a generally recog-nized property of traditional knowledge. The narrative   
"posts"(sender, addressee, hero) are so organized that the right to occupy  
the post of sender receives the following double grounding: it is  
based upon the fact of having occupied the post of addressee, and of  
having been recounted oneself, by virtue of the name one bears, by   
aprevious narrative—in other words, having been positioned as the  
diegetic reference of other narrative events.80  
The knowledge trans-mitted by these narrations is in no way limited to the functions of  
enunciation; it determines in a single stroke what one must say in  
order to be heard, what one must listen to in order to speak, and  
what role one must play (on the scene of diegetic reality) to be the  
object of a narrativ

48

Thusthespeechacts81  
relevanttothisformofknowledgeareper-formed not only by the speaker, but also by the listener, as well as  
by the third party referred to. The knowledge arising from such an  
apparatus may seem "condensed" in comparison with what I call  
"developed" knowledge. Our example clearly illustrates that a narra-tive tradition is also the tradition of the criteria defining a threefold  
competence —"know-how," "knowing how to speak," and "knowing  
how to hear" [savoir-faire, savoir-dire, savoir-entendre] —through  
which the community's relationship to itself and its environment is  
played out. What is transmitted through these narratives is the set of  
pragmatic rules that constitutes the social bon

48

A fourth aspect of narrative knowledge meriting careful examina-tion is its effect on time. Narrative form follows a rhythm; it is the  
synthesis of a meter beating time in regular periods and of accent  
modifying the length or amplitude of certain of those periods.82  
This  
vibratory, musical property of narrative is clearly revealed in the  
ritual performance of certain Cashinahua tales: they are handed  
down in initiation ceremonies, in absolutely fixed form, in a language  
whose meaning is obscured by lexical and syntactic anomalies, and  
they are sung as interminable, monotonous chants.83  
It is a strange  
brand of knowledge, you may say, that does not even make itself  
understood to the young men to whom it is addressed!

49

And yet this kind of knowledge is quite common; nursery rhymes  
are of this type, and repetitive forms of contemporary music have  
tried to recapture or at least approximate it. It exhibits a surprising  
feature: as meter takes precedence over accent in the production of  
sound (spoken or not), time ceases to be a support for memory to  
become an immemorial beating that, in the absence of a noticeable  
separation between periods, prevents their being numbered and con-signs them to oblivion.84  
Consider the form of popular sayings, pro-verbs, and maxims: they are like little splinters of potential narratives,  
or molds of old ones, which have continued to circulate on certain  
levels of the contemporary social edifice. In their prosody can be  
recognized the mark of that strange temporalization that jars the  
golden rule of our knowledge: "never forget."

49

Now there must be a congruence between this lethal function of  
narrative knowledge and the functions, cited earlier, of criteria for-mation, the unification of areas of competence, and social regulation.  
By way of a simplifying fiction, we can hypothesize that, against all  
expectations, a collectivity that takes narrative as its key form of  
competence has no need to remember its past. It finds the raw ma-terial for its social bond not only in the meaning of the narratives it  
recounts, but also in the act of reciting them. The narratives' refer-ence may seem to belong to the past, but in reality it is always con-temporaneous with the act of recitation. It is the present act that on  
each of its occurrences marshals in the ephemeral temporality in-habiting the space between the "I have heard" and the "you will  
hear."

49

The important thing about the pragmatic protocol of this kind of  
narration is that it betokens a theoretical identity between each of  
the narrative's occurrences. This may not in fact be the case, and  
often is not, and we should not blind ourselves to the element of  
humor or anxiety noticeable in the respect this etiquette inspires.  
The fact remains that what is emphasized is the metrical beat of the  
narrative occurrences, not each performance's differences in accent.  
It is in this sense that this mode of temporality can be said to be si-multaneously evanescent and immemorial.85

49

Finally, a culture that gives precedence to the narrative form  
doubtless has no more of a need for special procedures to authorize  
its narratives than it has to remember its past. It is hard to imagine  
such a culture first isolating the post of narrator from the others in  
order to give it a privileged status in narrative pragmatics, then in-quiring into what right the narrator (who is thus disconnected from  
the narratee and diegesis) might have to recount what he recounts,THE POSTMODERN CONDITION P 23  
and finally undertaking the analysis or anamnesis of its own legiti-macy. It is even harder to imagine it handing over the authority for  
its narratives to some incomprehensible subject of narration. The  
narratives themselves have this authority. In a sense, the people are  
only that which actualizes the narratives: once again, they do this  
not only by recounting them, but also by listening to them and re-counting themselves through them; in other words, by putting them  
into "play" in their institutions—thus by assigning themselves the  
posts of narratee and diegesis as well as the post of narrato

50

There is, then, an incommensurability between popular narrative  
pragmatics, which provides immediate legitimation, and the language  
game known to the West as the question of legitimacy —or rather,  
legitimacy as a referent in the game of inquiry. Narratives, as we have  
seen, determine criteria of competence and/or illustrate how they are  
to be applied. They thus define what has the right to be said and  
done in the culture in question, and since they are themselves a part  
of that culture, they are legitimated by the simple fact that they do  
what they do.
