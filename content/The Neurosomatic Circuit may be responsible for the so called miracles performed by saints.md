## The Neurosomatic Circuit may be responsible for the so called miracles performed by saints  # 

The lives of the saints are full of stories which seem like “miracles” to the [[The eight circuits of consciousness|four-circuited]] majority, or are rejected as “lies, hoaxes, yams” by the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit|Semantic Circuit]]ed dogmatic Rationalist, but which seem perfectly normal from the viewpoint of [[Neurosomatic Circuit]] consciousness. The saint says he is in rapture, and full of gratitude to God, for giving him such a feast for dinner as—plain bread and water. (Of course, many a pot-heads will understand that degree of neurosomatic rapture . . .) The guru comes into the room and his bio-energy has such a charge that a cripple jumps up and is “healed”; the cripple merely acquired neurosomatic turn-on by contact, as some people get "contact high” when others are on drugs. By bio-energy we mean nothing “mystical.” It is now known that many physical energies radiate from the body, and that even chemical effects can be transmitted (experienced as emotional “vibes”) from one person to another, the chemicals acting as stimuli to trigger neurotransmitter actions in the second person. The fire-walkers in many shamanic traditions walk on the fire, as they tell enquiring anthropologists, to prove their control over “the spirit”—i.e., to demonstrate to themselves and others that they have achieved high-quality neurosomatic tuning.
