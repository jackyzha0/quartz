## A Photograph

![Makiling and cows](lilim/images/023/Makiling-and-cows.jpg)

The beauty of a poem  
Is not in the words chosen  
Or the rhythm  
Or metaphors  
Or syllables  
Or in the sounds  
Of hands applauding  
From behind the reader’s eyes  

It is not even in the breath  
That flows within the poet  
As he breathes out the words  

No, we cannot know for sure  
for the beauty of a poem  
He alone sees it  

No one else can  

And it has to be that way  
For he who cannot see beauty  
by himself  
Cannot show the world  


## A Thought

**There is no single purpose everyone must follow, and it is highly plausible that the universe has no predetermined destiny for each of us.**

What seems to the case is that we enter life with a tabula rasa, and we create what we paint on it. An evidence for this might be the fact that as children, we don’t think about purpose. In fact, We only think about purpose when we are existentially lost—something a child is incapable of doing simply because a child is incapable of being existentially lost. A child follows what feels good and interesting.
