I am awake. For a little under 6 weeks now I've been sleeping with a CPAP machine every night and it has made a significant difference to my mental awareness. I felt the change the first morning and half way through the second week I was at work wondering why everyone was thinking so slowly!

My attention has been everywhere. I've had more time in the day to think, so I have. 

A lot of my time has been looking into landscape photography. Something made me revive my 17 year old Canon 400D DSLR. The lure of being a "photographer" is something that has always pulled at me. Of all pastimes, one that I felt I could be decent at. In 1999-2000 I lived in the UK and had the time to compose and take photos. That time was lost and I'm finding it again. I am also very much learning and time has been sunk into that as well. Throw in some [[Astrophotography]] and my mind has been well and truly occupied.

Never mind camera research to replace the 400D with a Canon R50.

I've posted a few photos at [@dcbuchan's Portfolio](https://pixelfed.au/i/portfolio/dcbuchan) but have not yet settled on what I want to do. Perhaps I'll end up posting on this site. I'm also in the early stages of a long post on how I take photos from the camera to curated family archive state. The more I learn, the more it changes in minute ways.
