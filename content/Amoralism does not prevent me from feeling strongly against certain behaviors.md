Just because I am an amoralist doesn't mean that I will have to love the unloveable. [[Amoralism]] is a metaphysical stance, which means I am simply believing on a statement about what does or does not exist. In this case, the claim that I am persuaded into is that there are no absolute, objective, and naturally occuring values.

This belief does not prevent me from feeling strongly about certain behaviors like abusive and violent behaviors. I don't think I want to be around poeple exhibiting these behaviors and if there is a way for me to prevent them from abusing more, and I am in that capacity, then I should act. I am acting purely out of emotions and practical reasons.

My difference from a moralist could simply be that I do not use talk about "inherent rights" or morality to achieve my goals. But I could imagine a situation where I feel very strongly about protecting victims or would-be victims from an abuser. Amoralism does not automatically make me good or bad. It doesn't even want to use those words. Amoralism does not automatically make me an advocate for safety and lessening of suffering. But it does help me to [[thoughts/see things as they really are]] and from there, hopefully I can lead to my desired course of action.
