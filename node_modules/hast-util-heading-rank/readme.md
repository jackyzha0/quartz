## What is this?

This package is a utility that lets you get the rank (`1`, `6`) of heading
elements (`h1`, `h6`).

## When should I use this?

This utility is pretty niche, if you’re here you probably know what you’re
looking for!

To change heading ranks, use
[`hast-util-shift-heading`][hast-util-shift-heading].

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 14.14+ and 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install hast-util-heading-rank
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {headingRank} from 'https://esm.sh/hast-util-heading-rank@2'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {headingRank} from 'https://esm.sh/hast-util-heading-rank@2?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {h} from 'hastscript'
import {headingRank} from 'hast-util-heading-rank'

headingRank(h('p', 'Alpha')) //=> null
headingRank(h('h5', 'Alpha')) //=> 5
```

## API
