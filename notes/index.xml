You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you&amp;rsquo;d like to get.
The majority of configuration can be be found under data/config.yaml. An annotated example configuration is shown below.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! You can head to &amp;lt;YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/quartz to see it live.
By default, Github Actions will run on forks of repos. You should not need to do any more config to see it up to date.
Custom subdomain Have a fancy custom domain or want to subdomain your Quartz?</description></item><item><title>Editing Content in Quartz</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/editing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/editing/</guid><description>Editing Quartz runs on top of Hugo so all notes are written in Markdown .
All content in your garden can found in the /content folder. To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you&amp;rsquo;d like.
To edit the main home page, open /content/_index.md.
To create a link, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question.</description></item><item><title>Obsidian Vault Integration</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/obsidian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/obsidian/</guid><description>Setup Obsidian is the preferred way to use Quartz. You can either create a new Obsidian Vault or link one that your already have.
New Vault If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an existing Vault, download Obsidian and create a new Vault in the /content folder that you created and cloned during the setup .
Linking an existing Vault The easiest way to use an existing Vault is to copy all of our files (directory and hierarchies intact) into the /content folder.</description></item><item><title>Setup</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/setup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/setup/</guid><description>Making your own Quartz Setting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of git. If you are unfamiliar, this resource is a great place to start!
Forking A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
Navigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:
📁 Quartz Repository Then, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account.</description></item><item><title>Troubleshooting and FAQ</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/troubleshooting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/troubleshooting/</guid><description>Common Pitfalls How come my notes aren&amp;rsquo;t being rendered? You probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup Obsidian to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in the &amp;lsquo;how to edit&amp;rsquo; guide .
My custom domain isn&amp;rsquo;t working! Walk through the steps in the hosting guide again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.</description></item></channel></rss>
